{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-10-2021 11:42 PM] <Michael Schmitt> He is also being very disingenuous about how variants work and while he’s not a virologist, an evo-devo biologist would certainly now how they work. Variants are caused by random mutations. More virus in the world means more opportunity for mutations means more likelihood of dangerous variant. The vaccines do not cause variants. The virus does not “respond” to the vaccine or natural immunity to overcome it (something Weinstein actually said in the Tucker interview)."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-10-2021 11:47 PM] <Michael Schmitt> A breakthrough variant is simply a random natural mutation that happens to evade vaccine immunity. The vaccines slow the spread of the virus thus reducing the amount of virus around thus reducing the likelihood of breakthrough variants. Thus, it is intentionally misleading (i.e., false) to say that the vaccines could “cause” breakthrough variants to come about. Nothing about the vaccine makes it more or less likely for such a variant to exist"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-10-2021 11:49 PM] <Michael Schmitt> Than with unchecked spread (other than the aggregate probability being lower from reduced spread with increased vaccination, but the probability of a given mutation being a breakthrough variant or not is not effected by the vaccine)"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-10-2021 11:53 PM] <Michael Schmitt> Weinstein also has to know that the spike protein is how the virus gets into your cell in order to replicate so his point about vaccines having limited immunity because they only provide immunity with respect to the spike protein is also intentionally misleading."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-11-2021 07:58 PM] <Joe Janiczek> ￼ Sorry it took me a while to reply to your posts from last night. I definitely appreciate you taking the time to write all of that up but I still don't agree with you assessment that he is intentionally misleading / lying / grifting / etc. Obviously scientists disagree routinely and that is a part of the scientific method, so it's fine if you don't agree with his hypotheses. I just don't think it's fair to say he is a grifter and/or knowingly lying about this stuff in order to make money. From every conversation I have heard with him, while he is certainly a contrarian, he tackles the issue from the standpoint of trying to get to the truth of the matter and trying to help. If anything, speaking out on this topic has cost him a substantial amount of money. (He claims to have lost 1/2 of his income due to YouTube completely demonetizing his channel). \n\nRegarding all of the vaccine mutation hypotheses, it wasn't something I had heard him speak about in depth so I found an interview he did with a virologist / vaccinologist  that goes in depth on the topic. It's actually a really interesting discussion IMO. While it certainly falls into the category of a \"hypothesis\", the argument seems logically coherent and should at least be something worthy of debate. I would try to summarize the hypothesis, but it's a bit complicated and obviously out of my domain of competence, so if you're interested in hearing the full argument give it a listen.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNyAovuUxro"}

There's nothing wrong with that in the domain of science. We need people who are challenging the status quo in order to advance our understanding in the long run. I think it is wrong and ultimately counterproductive to censor legitimate scientific conversations no matter how provocative the topic is.\n\nAgain, you don't have to agree with him but I am personally confident that he's doing his best to think through and talk about different topics in an intellectually honest way.

{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-12-2021 12:22 PM] <Joe Janiczek> So it looks like it IS a taxable event.

{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-13-2021 08:47 AM] <Michael Schmitt> Would you say it’s not good if wage growth outpaces inflation?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-13-2021 08:48 AM] <Michael Schmitt> Just an honest question. I would say then it’s fine."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-13-2021 08:49 AM] <Michael Schmitt> Well yeah, if wage growth is less than inflation then it’s obviously bad"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-13-2021 08:49 AM] <Michael Schmitt> Or at least not good"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-13-2021 08:49 AM] <Max Schwanebeck> My raise this year was 1.51%"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-13-2021 08:49 AM] <Max Schwanebeck> That is a higher wage"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-13-2021 08:51 AM] <Michael Schmitt> Yeah and it will probably be lower than inflation is this year, unfortunately"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-13-2021 08:54 AM] <Michael Schmitt> I just don’t think it’d be that bad if relatively wealthy people had to face 2-4% inflation for a couple years when low income workers, who haven’t gotten to benefit from massively increased productivity in forever, get some wage growth that outpaces inflation"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-13-2021 08:55 AM] <Michael Schmitt> Of course that might not be what happens but I guess, to me, some moderate inflation isn’t a priori bad"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-13-2021 08:55 AM] <Max Schwanebeck> 2% is every year so we wouldn't be talking about that. That's the base case"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-13-2021 08:56 AM] <Matt Carter> Well when it hits housing, it disproportionately benefits the folks who already own everything. The poors lose again!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-13-2021 08:56 AM] <Michael Schmitt> We’ve been under 2% for a while so I don’t think that’s an accurate “base case”"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-13-2021 08:58 AM] <Michael Schmitt> Yes, well, there’s an answer for that that we have political trouble with - build a lot more housing"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-13-2021 09:11 AM] <Max Schwanebeck> And a lot was hangover from the housing collapse/financial crisis"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-13-2021 09:23 AM] <Joe Janiczek> IMO private central banks are the root cause of all of our economic ills including the record wealth inequality. Their manipulation of interest rate policy necessarily disproportionately benefits the wealthy who can tap into incredibly cheap money using leverage in order to take advantage of the resulting rise in asset prices. The inflection point is shown perfectly on this graph where the end of Bretton Woods (ie the gold standard), effectively unchains the central banks, and perfectly aligns with the decoupling of productivity and hourly compensation."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-13-2021 09:34 AM] <Matt Carter> I took bretton woods to be the act of establishing the USD as the global reserve currency. I have seen this graph showing the end of the gold standard right around that time. Generally i agree. The system of planned inflation and discounted money to banks disproportionately benefits the already wealthy. It's not to say that there is no way to get ahead, but the system is stacked for the ones who already own everything"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-13-2021 09:39 AM] <Joe Janiczek> So when the left criticizes capitalism and blames it for the wealth inequality etc, they should really be protesting the Fed & the bankers."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-13-2021 09:40 AM] <Matt Carter> It's a natural response to seeing that all their effort isn't enough, not a moral failing"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-13-2021 09:41 AM] <Joe Janiczek> That's the thing, I 100% feel for those who are disgusted with what's happening in the world. I just want to point them to the actual problem rather than blaming the greatest wealth creation tool the world has ever seen (ie free markets)."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-13-2021 09:46 AM] <Joe Janiczek> You should think about moving to Cuba. I heard they had great socialized medicine there!"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-13-2021 09:51 AM] <Joe Janiczek> Exactly! But my guess is you wouldn't want to live there, and the people there are trying to overthrow their socialist oppressive government. Almost like freedom is more important than being given free stuff by the government."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-13-2021 09:52 AM] <Krishnan Warrior> They're protesting the government cause their economy has gone to shit. And the USA is to blame for that, not socialism"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-13-2021 09:53 AM] <Matt Carter> You hand picked an example from a generally depressed, authoritarian regime. Taiwan has great Healthcare and a free market economy"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-13-2021 09:53 AM] <Matt Carter> I too can hand pick an example i like"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-13-2021 09:54 AM] <Joe Janiczek> My dig wasn't supposed to be directed at the socialized healthcare, so much as socialism as a whole."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-13-2021 09:54 AM] <Matt Carter> Healthcare can be equitably consumed with the option to pay extra for things outside the standard of care. Lifestyle choices will of course be confounding factors that lead to inequitable consumption of Healthcare"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-13-2021 09:56 AM] <Matt Carter> It's still a tough issue. Assuming the good in human nature, socialized, non profit medicine is a no brainer. Assuming the real, variable nature of humans, it gets fucking messy."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-13-2021 10:02 AM] <Krishnan Warrior> The problem is there's so much affecting health besides lifestyle choices, or even genetics. Things like race, poverty, where you live, etc have a real and measurable effect on mortality."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-13-2021 10:08 AM] <Matt Carter> Even if the Healthcare is covered, your employer might not afford you the time to receive care. If you have a shit job and you need every hour you can get to pay your bills but you don't get paid sick leave, you defer care."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-13-2021 10:16 AM] <Michael Schmitt> This seems reductive"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-13-2021 10:16 AM] <Krishnan Warrior> As reductive as \"they're trying to overthrow their socialist government\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-13-2021 10:20 AM] <Michael Schmitt> Maybe! But the government cut off the internet. Seems like more authoritarianism at play. I’ll take the position that both reductions are bad."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-13-2021 10:23 AM] <Michael Schmitt> I agree with Carter that Taiwan would have been a better example. Higher life expectancy too"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-13-2021 12:49 PM] <Michael Schmitt> This seems like a weird conclusion. An embargo that's been in place for nearly 60 years and that contributed to the suffering of the Cuban people for all those years is now finally working as evidenced by Cuban people rising up?"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-13-2021 12:55 PM] <Michael Schmitt> \"Would've been nice if it worked sooner\" is begging the question. It presuppose that the embargo is the reason for what's happening right now"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-13-2021 12:58 PM] <Michael Schmitt> Well that has moved the goal posts from the original point"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-13-2021 12:59 PM] <Michael Schmitt> You argued the embargo was good and there was causality"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-13-2021 12:59 PM] <Michael Schmitt> Now you're switching to say the argument was that freeing the Cuban people is good"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-13-2021 01:00 PM] <Michael Schmitt> *your argument was"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-13-2021 01:00 PM] <Joe Janiczek> I'm saying that socialism and authoritarianism is evil, and when left unchecked leads to death and destruction at a level unrivaled in history. And that the ends justify the means of toppling such regimes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-13-2021 01:02 PM] <Joe Janiczek> Specifically, I think China is an existential threat to the world at this point."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-13-2021 01:02 PM] <Michael Schmitt> But \"the ends justify the means\" presupposes that that the means (embargo) were responsible for the ends accomplished (potentially, assuming something actually happens here)"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-13-2021 01:03 PM] <Joe Janiczek> Yes, I'm playing along with Krishnan's claim that the US caused this."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-13-2021 01:03 PM] <Michael Schmitt> Well you expressly made the point that the embargoes worked though and didn't back that up"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-13-2021 01:04 PM] <Michael Schmitt> I'm curious what Roshan was going to say"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-13-2021 01:04 PM] <Matt Carter> And Canada never got on board with the embargo because Justin Trudeau is Fidel Castro's biological son"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-13-2021 01:05 PM] <Michael Schmitt> The article I posted specifically takes the position that the Cuban government is bad and to blame for Cuba's ills but that the embargo exacerbated the issue without providing any clear benefit to either us or the Cubans."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-13-2021 01:09 PM] <Joe Janiczek> Either it didn't do anything, and the Cuban people are uprising against their authoritarian government on their own, which is good.\n\nOr it did in fact affect their economy in such a way that is leading to the people rising up and overthrowing their government, which is good."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-13-2021 01:10 PM] <Joe Janiczek> Meanwhile, Krishnan ostensibly wants to bring Cuban style socialism to the US. Which I'm maintaining is evil."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-13-2021 01:11 PM] <Michael Schmitt> But in the first case it arguably prolonged the regime and caused the Cuban people to suffer"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-13-2021 01:11 PM] <Michael Schmitt> You’re billing your dichotomy as a win win"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-13-2021 01:11 PM] <Joe Janiczek> How so? In what way could exerting economic pressure prolong the regime?"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-13-2021 01:13 PM] <Michael Schmitt> Because it does nothing to weaken the autocratic control and significantly aids in propaganda efforts"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-13-2021 01:14 PM] <Michael Schmitt> I would argue that doing everything we can to expose repressed people to the benefits of free society will increase their desire to realize that for themselves"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-13-2021 01:14 PM] <Michael Schmitt> Also the lack of contact with the outside world generally makes controlling people easier"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-13-2021 01:15 PM] <Michael Schmitt> And embargoes contribute to that isolation"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-13-2021 01:15 PM] <Joe Janiczek> They are literally waving American flags and chanting for freedom. I'm pretty sure they understand the benefits of a free society."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-13-2021 01:16 PM] <Michael Schmitt> Right. But that sense could have been fostered earlier without the embargo"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-13-2021 01:16 PM] <Michael Schmitt> And on the flip side, how did the embargo contribute to that understanding in any way? That’s what you’re arguing, that it did."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-13-2021 01:16 PM] <Krishnan Warrior> Only took 60 years and countless deaths/suffering to accomplish that couple thousand person strong protest"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-13-2021 01:20 PM] <Joe Janiczek> I'm not saying is an ideal solution. But sending money to an authoritarian regime seems even more counterproductive."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-13-2021 01:21 PM] <Krishnan Warrior> Yeah idk, I'm not like pro Castro here but it seems like what we've done in Cuba, and really what we've done throughout Latin America, with the ostensible goal of stopping the spread of communism, is super fucked"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-13-2021 01:22 PM] <Michael Schmitt> It goes both ways. We also send them stuff."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-13-2021 01:23 PM] <Joe Janiczek> What's the alternative then? We've seen how those systems all inevitably end. You can vote socialism in but you can't vote it out."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-13-2021 01:37 PM] <Michael Schmitt> Ok here’s one for Roshan. Do you think it’s more likely that the CIA (or government as a whole) has an alien body or has made productive two way communication with an alien (whether face to face or remotely)?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-13-2021 01:39 PM] <Roshan Choxi> Hmm I’d say alien body because there’s a lot more anecdotes about that from former military officials"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-18-2021 06:58 PM] <Michael Schmitt> I’ll use it to confirm my priors that the lab leak is real. Late 2019 drop off in scented candle ratings proves that Covid was more prevalent earlier than we knew"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-18-2021 06:55 PM] <Matt Carter> What precludes anyone on the list from being a criminal?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-18-2021 06:55 PM] <Michael Schmitt> Well that would certainly be an argument that they weren’t in violation of the license"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-19-2021 08:45 AM] <Michael Schmitt> They did just weirdly rebook my Raleigh Durham flight direct to O’Hare to have a layover in Detroit but it got in at the same time as the originally scheduled flight so 🤷🏽‍♂️"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-19-2021 08:46 AM] <Matt Carter> Spirit is probably the worst I have flown on. If they miss their runway time, they go to the back of the line. It's like 40 minutes added wait time in the plane"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-19-2021 08:47 AM] <Matt Carter> But if you ever need anything from Delta. Any changes. I recall that being a bad time."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-19-2021 08:50 AM] <Michael Schmitt> My general take is that amongst the major airlines, they’re all basically the same, and people’s preferences are arbitrary or driven by specific unlucky personal experiences. Very frequent travelers like to seem like they’re really in the know about the best one but it’s mostly just gatekeeping."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-19-2021 08:50 AM] <Michael Schmitt> Budget airlines being a different story"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-19-2021 08:52 AM] <Michael Schmitt> (Not that it’s wrong to have a personal preference, I just don’t put too much weight in it.)"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-19-2021 09:05 AM] <Roshan Choxi> Yeah they don’t control the airports and they all buy the same planes from Boeing, there isn’t a lot they can do to differentiate. Spirit and Delta unbundle the price of a seat with the price of luggage storage and other in-flight benefits so that’s how they make the tickets cheaper"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-19-2021 09:06 AM] <Roshan Choxi> There was a planet money episode a while back about an airline that made more money selling oil futures than through flying planes"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-19-2021 09:06 AM] <Krishnan Warrior> I think everyone's preference probs has most to do with whatever flies more from their home airport. I prefer United cause I mostly fly from O'Hare. I'd probably prefer Delta if I was in Atlanta or something"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-19-2021 09:06 AM] <Michael Schmitt> Delta doesn't do the unbundling but yeah, I think that's right. There's some minor variation in customer service etc. but at some point they're tied by available tickets, takeoff slots, etc."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-19-2021 09:06 AM] <Roshan Choxi> Virgin differentiates by hiring hot stewardesses"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-19-2021 09:07 AM] <Michael Schmitt> Yeah. I was flying AA to Philadelphia and fly United to Chicago and Delta to Minneapolis."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-19-2021 09:07 AM] <Krishnan Warrior> The best airline tho is Qatar"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-19-2021 09:07 AM] <Michael Schmitt> Yeah"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-19-2021 09:07 AM] <Krishnan Warrior> That oil money does it right"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-19-2021 09:07 AM] <Michael Schmitt> The A-rabs do know how to run an airline"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-19-2021 09:08 AM] <Michael Schmitt> I do like how it's kind of like the airlines are just like marketing for them"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-19-2021 09:10 AM] <Roshan Choxi> Iceland used to subsidize WOW airline flights to Iceland so they could boost tourism."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-19-2021 09:10 AM] <Matt Carter> Once they stopped, WOW folded"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-19-2021 09:10 AM] <Roshan Choxi> Yeah in a blaze of glory too. They shut down literally in the middle of their flights, people got stranded"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-19-2021 09:11 AM] <Michael Schmitt> Yeah. That saga was fucked. Literally left flight attendants overseas and weren't going to pay for them to get home"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-19-2021 09:11 AM] <Krishnan Warrior> Wow didn't really have much to offer beyond that Iceland deal tho"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-19-2021 09:11 AM] <Krishnan Warrior> Substantially shittier than easyjet"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-19-2021 09:11 AM] <Matt Carter> Southwest prioritizes customer service, so you don't get change fees. Your money is good for a year and you just update at current prices"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-19-2021 09:12 AM] <Michael Schmitt> Yeah. Southwest going all in on its model is interesting"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-19-2021 09:12 AM] <Jonas Owen> Yeah I like Southwest. They fly out of Burbank which is right next to me"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-19-2021 09:12 AM] <Matt Carter> For business, I'll fly delta, AA, or United. I'm not paying the fees if someone fucks up"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-19-2021 09:13 AM] <Matt Carter> They also play nice with each other over delays. They'll rebook you between those three no problem"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-19-2021 09:13 AM] <Matt Carter> SW is not in that cartel"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-19-2021 09:13 AM] <Michael Schmitt> The treating the plane like a greyhound bus when making a connection is a little weird"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-19-2021 09:14 AM] <Krishnan Warrior> I honestly never fly Southwest, Midway is just kinda inconvenient for me"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-19-2021 09:14 AM] <Roshan Choxi> A lot of major airlines focus on loyalty programs and perks, which I think is sort of a way of confusing people with math so they can’t really decide what the best option is"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-19-2021 09:15 AM] <Roshan Choxi> “Earning miles” is probably the only innovation airlines have had since the 70s. Maybe in-flight WiFi counts"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-19-2021 09:16 AM] <Roshan Choxi> Airplanes were actually somehow better in the 70s. People could stand up and walk around, it was more like a lounge than a prison bus"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-19-2021 09:17 AM] <Krishnan Warrior> And airports are so much of a worse experience too post-9/11"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-19-2021 09:17 AM] <Krishnan Warrior> Prelude to an orgy tbh"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-19-2021 09:20 AM] <Michael Schmitt> Yeah. That's pretty good, only going back to 1995."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-19-2021 09:27 AM] <Michael Schmitt> Lol. Yeah. I just meant, going back to 1979. I had this impression that in the 70's airfares were still like 1-2k inflation adjusted"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-19-2021 11:19 AM] <Max Schwanebeck> Southwest has the best model for casual travelers going shorter routes. Business travel is a different ball game"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-19-2021 11:20 AM] <Max Schwanebeck> But there's a reason SWA is the only airline that hasn't gone bankrupt or been unprofitable (unsure if COVID bucked the profitability situation)"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-19-2021 11:26 AM] <Michael Schmitt> Best model for the company at least. The refundability is nice for consumers. But, most times I've looked the itineraries are suboptimal relative to others, assuming you're willing to pay a small price premium."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-19-2021 11:29 AM] <Max Schwanebeck> Definitely true cross-country or not their main routes. Hence why I flew JetBlue to/from Boston. I always fly United for work because they're the only non-stop from San Diego to DC"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-21-2021 10:22 AM] <Michael Schmitt> Right and if delta is more transmissible amongst kids, they may still be at pretty low risk but the absolute numbers are going to be much bigger"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-21-2021 10:23 AM] <Max Schwanebeck> I actually wanted to ask about this, why aren't the vaccines currently approved for children?"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-21-2021 10:25 AM] <Matt Carter> Shit. Should have used reply. Meant to say autism was up 20% with the new vaccine"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-21-2021 10:25 AM] <Michael Schmitt> Damn. Yeah. That’s a little scary. More kids start dying and I think it’ll really change attitudes"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-21-2021 10:26 AM] <Michael Schmitt> Even if they can successfully message that *adults* should get the vaccine to help kids. It becomes an easier choice"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-21-2021 10:26 AM] <Krishnan Warrior> In fairness, it's likely cause a larger proportion of other age groups are vaxxed"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-21-2021 10:33 AM] <Michael Schmitt> Yeah. That’s a weird part of that point of debate to me. The presumption that the vaccine is somewhat likely to likely to have negative long term effects but that Covid isn’t."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-21-2021 10:36 AM] <Michael Schmitt> Yeah, the school/daycare thing was pretty botched from the beginning, or at least not handled in an unbiased way.

{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-21-2021 11:42 AM] <Michael Schmitt> Yeah. I also meant that the developmental issues from the school shutdowns were significantly and, I don’t think, appropriately weighed against the risks of Covid to children."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-05-2021 10:50 AM] <Joe Janiczek> I mean, that's definitely my opinion but I'm surprised that you said it as well. 🤣"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-05-2021 10:52 AM] <Michael Schmitt> I’d also be pretty curious to see how it broke down for STEM vs humanities PhDs"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-05-2021 10:52 AM] <Joe Janiczek> Also, doesn't operation mockingbird make you a little suspicious about everything the mainstream puts out? In my opinion almost everything in the mainstream media is full of distortions, lies, and half truths in order to create their narratives. Obviously you guys don't see it, and probably think I'm a nut, but once you see it you can't unsee it."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-05-2021 10:57 AM] <Michael Schmitt> Yeah. A lot of it is definitely biased but you can read it with skepticism still. I also haven’t seen that alternative media is any better."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-05-2021 10:58 AM] <Michael Schmitt> Maybe people are more likely to read alternative media with healthy skepticism that would be good to apply to MSM"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-05-2021 11:00 AM] <Michael Schmitt> Sure but your impression of the “distortion” is based on your own biases (as is everyone’s)"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-05-2021 11:00 AM] <Krishnan Warrior> Yeah I think these alternative media sites often have just as much if not more of a bias and distortions than mainstream media"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-05-2021 11:04 AM] <Joe Janiczek> Yeah but at least most of the alternative media sites are openly either conservative or liberal. And there's nothing wrong with giving the news with a conservative/liberal bent if you are open about it. It's when institutions claiming to be unbiased \"journalist\" inject left wing talking points into the stories while still insisting on being neutral."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-05-2021 11:10 AM] <Michael Schmitt> I agree with you that more journalism should drop the pretense but I think it’s odd to claim that it’s somehow worse just because there is a pretense"}

It's good stuff once the light bulb goes on and you view the topic through a different lens. I'll be the first to acknowledge that the evangelical Christian types are one of the biggest roadblocks in the way for scientifically minded people to believing in God. Also, God has a man in the sky type figure is absolute bullshit and is in all intense and purposes a straw man that makes people like yourself look down on believers. Hopefully someday I might be able to help open some of your eyes in some way shape or form on this topic. 🙏🏻"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-30-2021 12:11 PM] <Matt Carter> I think there's actually a garbage collector that clears memory that no longer needs to be allocated, but my analogy is about the rigors of testing and things that still slip through.

{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-30-2021 12:12 PM] <Michael Schmitt> But that's the point. You can't prove there's a realistic non-zero probability of long term effects of a vaccine using an analogy, let alone one that only holds on the generalities"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-30-2021 12:16 PM] <Michael Schmitt> I'm saying there's no scientific evidence there would be anything close to a widespread long term effect.

{"prompt":"","completion":"[09-02-2021 05:14 PM] <Matt Carter> Texas has a different outlook on that. They call it \"good guy with a gun\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[09-02-2021 05:15 PM] <Matt Carter> As much as \"good guy with a gun\" is basically trash, i believe there's credence to \"potential bad guy who's pretty sure everyone in the room is armed\""}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[09-02-2021 05:32 PM] <Michael Schmitt> I had to scroll through my photos for a minute but I don't have that many and the preview frame is so obvious as to what it is. The dog would do that for a while, like 30-40 min and then stop."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[09-03-2021 10:09 AM] <Michael Schmitt> Like that ivermectin use seems to be exploding now, only months after the contrarians started pushing it. To the point that it’s a long enough lag that some (obviously not all) have stopped advocating its use."}

In fact, I'm pretty close to 100% recovered and feeling better than ever actually. I'm just taking this time to do a total life reset and haven't been on any social media or paying attention to just about anything online (as evidenced by the fact that I haven't been involved in our Signal chat haha.)\n\nI look forward to sharing my whole story with you guys at your wedding though. It was one heck of a roller coast ride with tons of twists and turns and actually makes for a pretty crazy story.\n\nHow did everything go at your bachelor party? Did you all have a good time?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[09-17-2021 12:09 PM] <Michael Schmitt> Great. Glad you're feeling better! Also glad to hear that you'll be able to make the wedding. Will it be all three of you (just trying to finalize numbers)? It was a very good weekend. Went for a long hike on Saturday and otherwise just sort of hung around and joked about. It was good to get away for a weekend - I hadn't been to the Adirondacks in almost two years."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[09-17-2021 12:21 PM] <Michael Schmitt> What if Joe's big new lease on life is just that he doesn't think hyperinflation is going to happen now?"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[09-17-2021 12:22 PM] <Joe Janiczek> Unfortunately I can't talk Trista into bringing Summer with/coming, so it will just be me. \n\nI'm glad you had a great weekend out there. I've never actually been out that way but I hear it's absolutely gorgeous! I've also never been to Boston so I'm looking forward to seeing/exploring the area. Should be a good time."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[09-17-2021 12:24 PM] <Michael Schmitt> No worries. That's been the case for a lot of people. Our friend is coming but the spouse/partner is unable to make it. Jonas is coming without Bo or Lucy."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[09-17-2021 12:33 PM] <Roshan Choxi> But what instigated the reset? He found god already didn’t he? Did he just find god again?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[09-17-2021 12:34 PM] <Matt Carter> He nearly died from going down a 4-year hard- right rabbit hole and made owning libs his life's work"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[09-17-2021 12:36 PM] <Jonas Owen> maybe he is going thrbmax approach. Hates liberals and liberal ideals but hates hard right more. So he's just angry"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[09-17-2021 12:37 PM] <Matt Carter> I'm hoping for a more gentle, corrective conservative Joe. Not that he got to \"fuck your feelings\" levels of cocksucker, but just not so damn reactive and argumentative."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[09-17-2021 12:49 PM] <Roshan Choxi> On second thought, it’s kind of a wild card thing to have a life reset so I’m hopeful the group dynamic won’t change much"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[09-18-2021 01:42 PM] <Max Schwanebeck> It is kind of crazy that a huge part of a career decision can very well be health insurance related"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[09-18-2021 01:43 PM] <Max Schwanebeck> Like \"I hate what I'm doing but I have to so I can afford healthcare for my family\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[09-18-2021 01:45 PM] <Krishnan Warrior> Basically every insurance company. It's cheaper than a lung transplant for sure"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[09-18-2021 01:46 PM] <Jonas Owen> much cheaper"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[09-18-2021 01:51 PM] <Jonas Owen> Some of the frames I put on, the company charges around 10 grand"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[09-18-2021 01:52 PM] <Michael Schmitt> Medicare is actually really efficient. Only like 3-4% goes to admin"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[09-18-2021 01:53 PM] <Michael Schmitt> No matter what we do, the very least we should do is decouple insurance from employment. It’s only the way it is because of the tax incentives that were given to employers for offering insurance."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[09-18-2021 01:53 PM] <Matt Carter> In total or at the government side? I do not believe this"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[09-18-2021 01:54 PM] <Michael Schmitt> Like total cost of running Medicare"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[09-18-2021 01:54 PM] <Michael Schmitt> 3-4% of it is admin."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[09-18-2021 01:54 PM] <Michael Schmitt> But you have to do apples to apples. Same calculation yields 20%+ for private insurance"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[09-18-2021 01:55 PM] <Matt Carter> I really don't believe that accounts for the hoops the provider goes through to get paid by Medicare"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[09-18-2021 01:55 PM] <Michael Schmitt> But they do that for regular insurance too"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[09-18-2021 01:55 PM] <Matt Carter> You have to fit your care to what Medicare will reimburse"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[09-18-2021 01:56 PM] <Michael Schmitt> And you don’t for private insurance?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[09-18-2021 01:56 PM] <Matt Carter> True, but i doubt that's encompassed by a 3-4% figure"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[09-18-2021 01:56 PM] <Michael Schmitt> Right but the point is that from the government expenditure side, Medicare is really efficient"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[09-18-2021 01:56 PM] <Michael Schmitt> And much more efficient than private insurance"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[09-18-2021 01:58 PM] <Michael Schmitt> Oh I’m sorry. Medicare is actually 2%"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[09-18-2021 01:58 PM] <Michael Schmitt> The government is a huge pit of waste and inefficiency for the most part but they really cracked the code on Medicare somehow"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[09-18-2021 01:59 PM] <Matt Carter> I've already said i want that sweet govt insurance for basic care with the option to pay more for elective care. We don't disagree. My point is that there's no fucking way this figure accounts for total cost to consumers, and i believe it's only factoring the administrative side for the government, not the care provider"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[09-18-2021 02:00 PM] <Matt Carter> I sincerely apologize for the run on sentence. I'm better than that."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[09-18-2021 02:01 PM] <Michael Schmitt> Oh yeah. Sorry. I wasn’t trying to be argumentative. I was really surprised when I found out the number myself"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[09-18-2021 02:02 PM] <Michael Schmitt> I think the Medicare For All proposal is stupid but would support simply removing the age requirement for existing Medicare"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[09-18-2021 02:03 PM] <Matt Carter> I recently learned that medicare gets really authoritative around your retirement years though, and I'm not happy about it"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[09-18-2021 02:03 PM] <Michael Schmitt> I also agree with you that it’s not all encompassing but the point is to compare to the existing system where it comes out ahead but like an order of magnitude"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[09-18-2021 02:03 PM] <Michael Schmitt> What does this mean?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[09-18-2021 02:04 PM] <Matt Carter> Premiums jack up really high if your income is over like 40k, which hasn't been adjusted since 40k was a decent amount of money"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[09-18-2021 02:05 PM] <Matt Carter> Make 41k? Premiums are $600/ month"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[09-18-2021 02:06 PM] <Matt Carter> Want to get private insurance instead of paying the $600/ month? That's illegal. You can only buy supplements to Medicare"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[09-18-2021 02:06 PM] <Michael Schmitt> Interesting. That does seem too low to kick in / could probably be more progressive"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[09-18-2021 02:06 PM] <Matt Carter> Want to wait to sign up after 65? Premiums go up 10% per year"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[09-19-2021 08:14 PM] <Michael Schmitt> Seems like even raking parents over the coals can’t be that lucrative if there’s like 20 kids in one spot"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[09-19-2021 08:14 PM] <Max Schwanebeck> Our cost for 2 kids was 2400. New one will be somewhere around 3300. The \"primrose\" takeover cost would be 4100"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[09-19-2021 08:14 PM] <Jonas Owen> And this specific one is associated with USC so it's close and we get a discount"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[09-19-2021 08:14 PM] <Max Schwanebeck> Same. We're switching to Kindercare"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[09-19-2021 08:15 PM] <Jonas Owen> We play around 2200 for Lucy"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[09-19-2021 08:15 PM] <Max Schwanebeck> Primrose is also a franchise"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[09-19-2021 08:16 PM] <Jonas Owen> Which sucks but it's not bad for the area. And it's really good daycare."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[09-19-2021 08:33 PM] <Matt Carter> Kindercare is also by us. Ours is tutor time, chosen because it is walking distance from home and not much more expensive than the competition"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[09-19-2021 08:34 PM] <Matt Carter> They just cut hours to prevent teachers from burning out but still raised rates"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[09-19-2021 08:35 PM] <Matt Carter> In the infant room, it doesn't make business sense to pay more than $14/ hour with the 4:1 limit"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[09-19-2021 08:58 PM] <Michael Schmitt> Where is the money going?"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[09-19-2021 09:02 PM] <Matt Carter> At 4:1 and a rate parents can stomach, a single teacher can book ~$1200/week. As a lawyer, you book that in 2-6 hours?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[09-19-2021 09:08 PM] <Michael Schmitt> Yeah but like if the teachers don’t own it, they’re making <$600/wk. And it would be less than 2hrs of my time for what I would bill for my time, 10hrs in terms of my take home."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[09-19-2021 09:10 PM] <Michael Schmitt> No question where the extra money that I bill out goes though. 😢"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[09-19-2021 09:12 PM] <Matt Carter> According to \"Suits\" you really want to get on contingency and bully corporations into taking your deal"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[09-19-2021 09:13 PM] <Matt Carter> But my point is that a $1200/week booking doesn't leave tons of room for employee pay"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[09-19-2021 09:15 PM] <Michael Schmitt> It’s risky but if you get a good one, you’re looking at a $20-80 million dollar payday"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[09-19-2021 09:15 PM] <Matt Carter> It's normal for me as a service engineer to book at least $6k/ week, and i still would cap off at 1/3 of that"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[09-19-2021 09:15 PM] <Michael Schmitt> Sure but there’s more than 4 kids at the daycare."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[09-19-2021 09:17 PM] <Michael Schmitt> Right but if the daycare has 28 kids at it, the excess over wages is 7*$600/wk"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[09-19-2021 09:19 PM] <Michael Schmitt> And that’s assuming you’re paying the workers $15 an hour (when the average is apparently ~$12.5) and using your $1200 monthly rate."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[10-11-2021 09:46 AM] <Matt Carter> Our meijer used to carry them. The pharmacist told Emily yesterday to stop wasting her time. Only Amazon, Walmart, and Walgreens are getting them"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[10-11-2021 09:47 AM] <Matt Carter> I recall an early coronavirus presser where Pence had all the corporate partners step forward. Walgreens was part of that. Sounds like there's cronie capitalism going on here."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[10-11-2021 09:48 AM] <Michael Schmitt> What I've seen is that supposedly there's just not many out there because there's generally low demand for them from customers trying to get them at private retailers"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[10-11-2021 09:48 AM] <Matt Carter> Walgreens will let you order them at normal prices. Amazon is higher. Never checked Walmart"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[10-11-2021 09:50 AM] <Matt Carter> I recall seeing that sales slumped with initial vaccination rollout, abbott slowed/stopped production, delta swept the world, and now there's a consistent supply shortage"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[10-11-2021 09:52 AM] <Michael Schmitt> That sounds right. What I had seen was maybe discussing that they didn’t expect any demand increase to be enough to justify amping production significantly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[10-11-2021 09:55 AM] <Max Schwanebeck> Along a similar vane, we just got notification of the vaccine mandate meaning everyone at NG has to get their last dose NLT Nov 24"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[10-11-2021 10:05 AM] <Michael Schmitt> Lol. Yeah. It's specifically because the law doesn't step in to protect workers that companies can fire you for not getting a vaccine"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[10-11-2021 10:06 AM] <Michael Schmitt> Just funny that right to work was a big anti-union push that worked and now a subset of those same people don't like the results because they have to get vaccinated"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[10-11-2021 12:57 PM] <Krishnan Warrior> I don't necessarily know how it's unconstitutional tho. There's nothing in the Constitution that says you can't mandate vaccines. seems to fit within OSHA"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[10-11-2021 01:13 PM] <Michael Schmitt> It’s not unconstitutional. It might be if it was a federal mandate, depending on how it’s structured. But statewide vaccine mandates are clearly constitutional (as part of the “police powers”) and federal mandates for contractors/federal employees are clearly constitutional as well since there’s no limit on tying strings to federal funds."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[10-11-2021 01:15 PM] <Max Schwanebeck> It is a federal mandate"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[10-11-2021 01:17 PM] <Max Schwanebeck> And then they limit the supply of tests so you can't get tested"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[10-11-2021 01:18 PM] <Michael Schmitt> I agree with that part that the government should do more to promote availability of tests"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[10-20-2021 08:31 AM] <Krishnan Warrior> That's fair but the point is there are some diseases with cures that aren't available because they're unprofitable"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[10-20-2021 08:33 AM] <Michael Schmitt> Yeah. I think the difference is it was actually commercialized (unsuccessfully), so the remedy should be targeted based on what actually happened."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[10-21-2021 09:38 AM] <Michael Schmitt> I didn't feel like working so I looked up what data was available on FRED (whose source is Realtor.com). Using median home size of housing inventory of the boroughs and populations weighting them, you get 729 sq ft vs. 1280 sq ft for SF, which makes the price per square foot to be $1138 for SF and $1095 for NY. So Matt was mostly right, the difference is mostly accounted for in size. The data seem odd for Queens though. It shows a median home size of 545 sq ft whereas even Manhattan is still 720 sq ft, which could be believable but weirdly there aren't any data before April 2020, unlike the other boroughs."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[10-22-2021 01:08 PM] <Michael Schmitt> Even that could be doubtful. If for example it was a blank that just went stray and no one particularly told the woman who died to stand where she was standing then it might just be purely accidental so everyone acted “reasonably”"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[10-22-2021 01:19 PM] <Krishnan Warrior> I mean I feel like they'd say that an actor handed a gun as part of filming a movie while on set would #reasonably 👆🏿 expect it to be safe to fire"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[10-22-2021 01:20 PM] <Michael Schmitt> Best argument for Baldwin’s criminal/civil liability is something like, regardless of what system is in place, anyone holding a gun knows they shouldn’t fire towards someone else even with a blank because a gun is so inherently dangerous and so it’s unreasonable to have fired it how he did. Best (and in my non-legal opinion better) counter is that (a) guns are inherently dangerous so the deceased/injured assumed the risk by being on set during filming where it would be discharged and (b) Baldwin only discharged the gun in the manner in which he was instructed and therefore he acted reasonably in the circumstances (which he could separately use to try to argue any liability he would have should transfer to his employer)."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[10-22-2021 01:24 PM] <Michael Schmitt> Yeah. But the legal theory rests on whether he had a duty to do that or not. Arguably in the circumstances he didn't, it was the duty of the prop supervisor."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[10-22-2021 01:24 PM] <Krishnan Warrior> But it's reasonable to assume that's been done by the people who have the job of making sure a prop is safe to use"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[10-22-2021 01:25 PM] <Michael Schmitt> Negligence requires you establish a duty of care first even before you question reasonableness in discharging the duty. Based on what we know right now, Baldwin could challenge both prongs"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[10-22-2021 01:28 PM] <Michael Schmitt> (One of the duties is literally \"duty of care of a reasonable person.\" haha. But what that is is context dependent. It's reasonable care in the context of the situation, which might simply be that Baldwin asked the prop supervisor \"is this gun good to fire?\" or maybe even just only handled guns given to him by the supervisor without any further questions/checks)"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[10-22-2021 02:45 PM] <Michael Schmitt> Lol. Well currently they’re centering on a requirement that childcare providers be paid teachers’ wages with a subsidy for lower income earners to help afford it but the subsidy has a drop off (not phase out) that’s currently at 100-130% of median income by state for the first three years (before there being no drop off)"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[10-22-2021 02:45 PM] <Michael Schmitt> But it looks like the drop off is headed towards being indefinitely capped at 200% or 150% of median household income"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[10-22-2021 03:03 PM] <Michael Schmitt> Yeah. I'm a single issue voter and my issue is that someone of moderately high income can't get even one $300 payment from the government ever because otherwise society will collapse"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[10-22-2021 03:10 PM] <Michael Schmitt> Yeah. Idk. The universal pre-k debate was so weirdly focused on child outcomes, which appear to not be affected by participation much based on recent research, when there's been no focus on allowing parents to work. Conservatives are so obsessed with people working and then don't pay any attention to barriers to that goal"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[10-22-2021 03:14 PM] <Michael Schmitt> To that end, providing a subsidy makes sense. Requiring some wage floor vs. just letting the subsidy act to provide wage pressure is debatable - I don't really have an opinion"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[10-23-2021 10:02 AM] <Michael Schmitt> Yeah. I was going to say that too. I could see how if Alec Baldwin is never around \"real\" guns and frequently around prop guns, his perspective gets warped/dulled"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[10-23-2021 10:04 AM] <Max Schwanebeck> Shit if I was on set filming and someone told me they handed a cold gun I would also assume it was cold. Except I work with a bunch of people who don't do their job so I know better"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[10-23-2021 10:07 AM] <Max Schwanebeck> The real tragedy is that a real bullet was fired on set only a few days earlier and nobody fucking checked to make sure the armorer wasn't retarded after that"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[10-23-2021 10:09 AM] <Michael Schmitt> And that's where I could see someone making an argument for AB's liability as producer. That they should have immediately fired the armorer or whoever else"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[10-23-2021 10:10 AM] <Michael Schmitt> Supposedly some of the prop people really wanted to fire the antique guns and so had took them out shooting and then someone some of the live ammo carried over onto set, or something along those lines"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[10-23-2021 10:11 AM] <Jonas Owen> Maybe I misread but a lot of the staff ended up leaving the set because they were worried about safety issues"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[10-23-2021 10:12 AM] <Michael Schmitt> Ah. Maybe. I hadn't seen that. I do know that a big part of the union staff walked out over working conditions but my understanding was it had to do with things like length of day and compensation."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[10-23-2021 10:13 AM] <Matt Carter> That's also ill-advised. At some point you just call a gun a \"wall hanger\" because it's so old that you can't trust it to hold up to the pressures anymore. My dad has a beautiful double barrel 10 ga shotgun that he has never nor will never fire because it was built when barrels were built by hammering sheet steel around a dowel"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[10-23-2021 10:18 AM] <Matt Carter> Any given ammunition specifies the pressure it's loaded to generate from the beginning, so antique weapons fired with modern ammunition should still fire at the same pressures it was built for, but they still weren't made with modern manufacturing techniques"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[10-29-2021 03:21 PM] <Roshan Choxi> Argentina? Zimbabwe? The European debt crisis after 2008?"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[10-29-2021 03:22 PM] <Max Schwanebeck> No fiat panda here"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[10-29-2021 03:23 PM] <Michael Schmitt> The latter point is fair but the European “debt crisis” was mostly hype or not actually about the debt. In any case, austerity didn’t work to fix the problem"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[10-29-2021 03:23 PM] <Michael Schmitt> Those countries have much lower debt burdens now and still shitty or even shittier economies"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[10-29-2021 03:24 PM] <Roshan Choxi> That doesn’t mean their situation wasn’t instigated by a debt crisis"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[10-29-2021 03:26 PM] <Roshan Choxi> But my broader point was that this is a special US privilege, and it’s fucking awesome honestly"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[10-29-2021 04:02 PM] <Michael Schmitt> MMT does get weirdly hung up on the dogma that taxes don’t pay for anything when it should be more like taxes don’t matter in terms of paying for things."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[10-29-2021 04:05 PM] <Roshan Choxi> Why don’t they matter?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[10-29-2021 04:06 PM] <Michael Schmitt> Because we can print money. Our ability to finance government spending is in no way contingent on taxation in an economic (or constitutional) sense."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[10-29-2021 04:07 PM] <Michael Schmitt> I’m not saying there can’t be issues with government spending"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[10-29-2021 04:08 PM] <Roshan Choxi> So when the government collects taxes, that doesn’t go into a bank somewhere?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[10-29-2021 04:08 PM] <Roshan Choxi> Bank(s)"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[10-29-2021 04:08 PM] <Michael Schmitt> They do go into accounts and they get spent!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[10-29-2021 04:08 PM] <Roshan Choxi> I hope it’s one though"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[10-29-2021 04:09 PM] <Michael Schmitt> Which is why the simplistic MMT take is dumb."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[10-29-2021 04:09 PM] <Max Schwanebeck> Can we just get rid of pennies and maybe even nickels at this point? Like is anything worth less than a dime anymore?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[10-29-2021 04:10 PM] <Matt Carter> A penny"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[10-29-2021 04:10 PM] <Michael Schmitt> But our ability to spend the money that the taxes covered wasn’t predicated on receiving the taxes"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[10-29-2021 04:10 PM] <Michael Schmitt> We could have printed it instead."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[10-29-2021 04:11 PM] <Matt Carter> But that devalues the money, which disproportionately affects the have-nots. It's a regressive tax, doubly so because it inflates the dollar value of an asset with a fixed intrinsic value"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[10-29-2021 04:13 PM] <Matt Carter> You can argue \"but the money spent by the government can provide for the have-nots\" but that doesn't actually keep the machine moving and providing things in abundance"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[10-29-2021 04:13 PM] <Michael Schmitt> MMT recognizes you can’t just flood the system and so counters that taxes are a way to balance the system by taking money out of it. Their counter to my point is that taxes are just receiving back money that the government created in the first place so my critique is invalid but that’s dumb - banks also create money that’s taxed so clearly not all taxes are government originated"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[10-29-2021 04:13 PM] <Matt Carter> Money doesn't create goods and services. People and machines do"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[10-29-2021 04:15 PM] <Roshan Choxi> How does congress create money if only the Fed can do that? I thought the Fed was independent"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[10-29-2021 04:15 PM] <Michael Schmitt> I think you have a slight confusion, the government is who issues the debt"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[10-29-2021 04:16 PM] <Michael Schmitt> Through the treasury"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[10-29-2021 04:16 PM] <Michael Schmitt> Which auctions off bonds"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[10-29-2021 04:16 PM] <Roshan Choxi> Oh I see"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[10-29-2021 04:20 PM] <Michael Schmitt> The Fed is the government’s bank"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[10-29-2021 04:23 PM] <Max Schwanebeck> And given Biden's inflation plan, my $13M RMD in 2059 is actually worth $100k in today's dollars"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[10-29-2021 06:04 PM] <Francisco Saldana> Wait till you see the prices on goods when our arable farmland starts migrating north! Wonder how much coffee, vanilla and chocolate will cost when there’s no longer a place on earth that can produce them outside. 🤣"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[10-29-2021 06:06 PM] <Francisco Saldana> Inflation is as much determined by productivity as it is money supply."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[10-29-2021 06:09 PM] <Francisco Saldana> Congress can order the treasury to mint a $2 trillion dollar coin. They can then pay any debt issued by the fed using that coin. So the logistical question of where the money gets printed is essentially irrelevant."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[11-06-2021 07:58 AM] <Max Schwanebeck> It is a leader's job to inspire people so they want to do things. Not mandate and force them because they're in charge. It wasn't just Trump supporters not getting vaccinated."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[11-06-2021 10:15 AM] <Michael Schmitt> The former is definitely true but I don't know that that lends causality to the latter claim. There are still a lot of US workers and regardless, it doesn't negate that a big increase in wages isn't enough to lure in US workers"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[11-18-2021 07:57 AM] <Michael Schmitt> Exactly. It became cool to LOVE Hamilton and passé to not have seen it and I think that made people take a more extreme attitude about it than the work actually warranted."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[11-18-2021 10:09 AM] <Michael Schmitt> So it includes a lot of government spending but I don’t think that makes it meaningless.

{"prompt":"","completion":"[11-18-2021 10:10 AM] <Michael Schmitt> Full on communist countries would still have a GDP and measuring its change over time is still indicative of progress because it signifies that the total value created by the society (denominated in currency) is growing"}
