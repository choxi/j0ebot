{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-06-2021 03:50 PM] Schmitty: Idk if anyone’s really tested the limits of it but generally you own everything above you into the sky and everything down into the earth, so state jurisdiction would presumably be no different."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-06-2021 03:50 PM] Schmitty: Eh. The speed doesn’t make sense given the demographics. Ridership is high and it actually turns a profit for Amtrak. You have to make more stops to get the ridership. I don’t think it’d work well if you cut out the stops to increase the speed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-06-2021 03:50 PM] Schmitty: So I meant to reply to this and then didn’t.

{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-10-2021 10:07 PM] Schmitty: He is also being very disingenuous about how variants work and while he’s not a virologist, an evo-devo biologist would certainly now how they work. Variants are caused by random mutations. More virus in the world means more opportunity for mutations means more likelihood of dangerous variant. The vaccines do not cause variants. The virus does not “respond” to the vaccine or natural immunity to overcome it (something Weinstein actually said in the Tucker interview)."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-10-2021 10:07 PM] Schmitty: A breakthrough variant is simply a random natural mutation that happens to evade vaccine immunity. The vaccines slow the spread of the virus thus reducing the amount of virus around thus reducing the likelihood of breakthrough variants. Thus, it is intentionally misleading (i.e., false) to say that the vaccines could “cause” breakthrough variants to come about. Nothing about the vaccine makes it more or less likely for such a variant to exist"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-10-2021 10:07 PM] Schmitty: Than with unchecked spread (other than the aggregate probability being lower from reduced spread with increased vaccination, but the probability of a given mutation being a breakthrough variant or not is not effected by the vaccine)"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-10-2021 10:07 PM] Schmitty: Weinstein also has to know that the spike protein is how the virus gets into your cell in order to replicate so his point about vaccines having limited immunity because they only provide immunity with respect to the spike protein is also intentionally misleading."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-10-2021 10:07 PM] Joe: ￼ Sorry it took me a while to reply to your posts from last night. I definitely appreciate you taking the time to write all of that up but I still don't agree with you assessment that he is intentionally misleading / lying / grifting / etc. Obviously scientists disagree routinely and that is a part of the scientific method, so it's fine if you don't agree with his hypotheses. I just don't think it's fair to say he is a grifter and/or knowingly lying about this stuff in order to make money. From every conversation I have heard with him, while he is certainly a contrarian, he tackles the issue from the standpoint of trying to get to the truth of the matter and trying to help. If anything, speaking out on this topic has cost him a substantial amount of money. (He claims to have lost 1/2 of his income due to YouTube completely demonetizing his channel). \n\nRegarding all of the vaccine mutation hypotheses, it wasn't something I had heard him speak about in depth so I found an interview he did with a virologist / vaccinologist  that goes in depth on the topic. It's actually a really interesting discussion IMO. While it certainly falls into the category of a \"hypothesis\", the argument seems logically coherent and should at least be something worthy of debate. I would try to summarize the hypothesis, but it's a bit complicated and obviously out of my domain of competence, so if you're interested in hearing the full argument give it a listen.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNyAovuUxro"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-10-2021 10:07 PM] Joe: In most of his podcasts he is literally thinking through the entire debate / argument out loud and admits that most of what he is laying out is his own personal hypotheses, and that he could ultimately be proven wrong. There's nothing wrong with that in the domain of science. We need people who are challenging the status quo in order to advance our understanding in the long run. I think it is wrong and ultimately counterproductive to censor legitimate scientific conversations no matter how provocative the topic is.\n\nAgain, you don't have to agree with him but I am personally confident that he's doing his best to think through and talk about different topics in an intellectually honest way. It sounds like you haven't listened to him in his long form podcasts and are just forming your opinion based on a made for TV interview in which he is forced to condense his views, thereby excluding nuance that is otherwise contained in the full length podcasts."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-10-2021 10:07 PM] Joe: So it looks like it IS a taxable event. But if someone wanted to avoid paying taxes and did it through unregulated means, it would be a lot harder to track down those records than if you traded in and out of USD going through a bank account."}

The inflection point is shown perfectly on this graph where the end of Bretton Woods (ie the gold standard), effectively unchains the central banks, and perfectly aligns with the decoupling of productivity and hourly compensation."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-10-2021 10:07 PM] Matt: I took bretton woods to be the act of establishing the USD as the global reserve currency. I have seen this graph showing the end of the gold standard right around that time. Generally i agree. The system of planned inflation and discounted money to banks disproportionately benefits the already wealthy. It's not to say that there is no way to get ahead, but the system is stacked for the ones who already own everything"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-10-2021 10:07 PM] Joe: So when the left criticizes capitalism and blames it for the wealth inequality etc, they should really be protesting the Fed & the bankers."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-10-2021 10:07 PM] Matt: It's a natural response to seeing that all their effort isn't enough, not a moral failing"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-10-2021 10:07 PM] Joe: That's the thing, I 100% feel for those who are disgusted with what's happening in the world. I just want to point them to the actual problem rather than blaming the greatest wealth creation tool the world has ever seen (ie free markets)."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-10-2021 10:07 PM] Joe: You should think about moving to Cuba. I heard they had great socialized medicine there!"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-10-2021 10:07 PM] Joe: Exactly! But my guess is you wouldn't want to live there, and the people there are trying to overthrow their socialist oppressive government. Almost like freedom is more important than being given free stuff by the government."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-10-2021 10:07 PM] Krishnan: They're protesting the government cause their economy has gone to shit. And the USA is to blame for that, not socialism"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-10-2021 10:07 PM] Matt: Healthcare can be equitably consumed with the option to pay extra for things outside the standard of care. Lifestyle choices will of course be confounding factors that lead to inequitable consumption of Healthcare"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-10-2021 10:07 PM] Matt: It's still a tough issue. Assuming the good in human nature, socialized, non profit medicine is a no brainer. Assuming the real, variable nature of humans, it gets fucking messy."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-10-2021 10:07 PM] Krishnan: The problem is there's so much affecting health besides lifestyle choices, or even genetics. Things like race, poverty, where you live, etc have a real and measurable effect on mortality."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-10-2021 10:07 PM] Matt: Even if the Healthcare is covered, your employer might not afford you the time to receive care. If you have a shit job and you need every hour you can get to pay your bills but you don't get paid sick leave, you defer care."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-10-2021 10:07 PM] Joe: I used to like McGregor when he could lose somewhat humbly and vow to come back and win. The guy has turned into a complete narcissistic douchebag now though. His post fight interview was disgusting."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-10-2021 10:07 PM] Krishnan: Yeah combat sports are as much about the pre and post match jawing as the actual fight when it comes to selling ppv"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-10-2021 10:07 PM] Schmitty: This seems like a weird conclusion. An embargo that's been in place for nearly 60 years and that contributed to the suffering of the Cuban people for all those years is now finally working as evidenced by Cuban people rising up?"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-10-2021 10:07 PM] Joe: Would've been nice if it worked sooner. Honestly, I think economic warfare is turning into the best tool to remove evil regimes in general. It'd be nice if the entire world would agree to a trade embargo with China in order to topple the CCP."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-10-2021 10:07 PM] Schmitty: \"Would've been nice if it worked sooner\" is begging the question. It presuppose that the embargo is the reason for what's happening right now"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-10-2021 10:07 PM] Joe: I'm saying that socialism and authoritarianism is evil, and when left unchecked leads to death and destruction at a level unrivaled in history. And that the ends justify the means of toppling such regimes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-10-2021 10:07 PM] Joe: Specifically, I think China is an existential threat to the world at this point."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-10-2021 10:07 PM] Schmitty: But \"the ends justify the means\" presupposes that that the means (embargo) were responsible for the ends accomplished (potentially, assuming something actually happens here)"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-10-2021 10:07 PM] Schmitty: The article I posted specifically takes the position that the Cuban government is bad and to blame for Cuba's ills but that the embargo exacerbated the issue without providing any clear benefit to either us or the Cubans."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-10-2021 10:07 PM] Joe: Either it didn't do anything, and the Cuban people are uprising against their authoritarian government on their own, which is good.\n\nOr it did in fact affect their economy in such a way that is leading to the people rising up and overthrowing their government, which is good."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-10-2021 10:07 PM] Schmitty: I would argue that doing everything we can to expose repressed people to the benefits of free society will increase their desire to realize that for themselves"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-10-2021 10:07 PM] Schmitty: Also the lack of contact with the outside world generally makes controlling people easier"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-10-2021 10:07 PM] Schmitty: And embargoes contribute to that isolation"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-10-2021 10:07 PM] Joe: They are literally waving American flags and chanting for freedom. I'm pretty sure they understand the benefits of a free society."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-10-2021 10:07 PM] Schmitty: And on the flip side, how did the embargo contribute to that understanding in any way? That’s what you’re arguing, that it did."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-10-2021 10:07 PM] Krishnan: Yeah idk, I'm not like pro Castro here but it seems like what we've done in Cuba, and really what we've done throughout Latin America, with the ostensible goal of stopping the spread of communism, is super fucked"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-10-2021 10:07 PM] Schmitty: It goes both ways. We also send them stuff."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-10-2021 10:07 PM] Schmitty: Ok here’s one for Roshan. Do you think it’s more likely that the CIA (or government as a whole) has an alien body or has made productive two way communication with an alien (whether face to face or remotely)?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-10-2021 10:07 PM] Roshan: Hmm I’d say alien body because there’s a lot more anecdotes about that from former military officials"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-14-2021 09:36 PM] Krishnan: The one in NEJM also looking at mild covid that was negative was probably the most high quality, but again was kinda small"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-18-2021 06:58 PM] Schmitty: I’ll use it to confirm my priors that the lab leak is real. Late 2019 drop off in scented candle ratings proves that Covid was more prevalent earlier than we knew"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-18-2021 06:58 PM] Schmitty: Yeah. A lot of people were really pissed Apple made that changed.

{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-18-2021 07:09 PM] Schmitty: They did just weirdly rebook my Raleigh Durham flight direct to O’Hare to have a layover in Detroit but it got in at the same time as the originally scheduled flight so 🤷🏽‍♂️"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-18-2021 07:09 PM] Matt: Spirit is probably the worst I have flown on. If they miss their runway time, they go to the back of the line. It's like 40 minutes added wait time in the plane"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-18-2021 07:09 PM] Schmitty: My general take is that amongst the major airlines, they’re all basically the same, and people’s preferences are arbitrary or driven by specific unlucky personal experiences.

{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-18-2021 07:09 PM] Roshan: Yeah they don’t control the airports and they all buy the same planes from Boeing, there isn’t a lot they can do to differentiate. Spirit and Delta unbundle the price of a seat with the price of luggage storage and other in-flight benefits so that’s how they make the tickets cheaper"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-18-2021 07:09 PM] Roshan: There was a planet money episode a while back about an airline that made more money selling oil futures than through flying planes"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-18-2021 07:09 PM] Krishnan: I think everyone's preference probs has most to do with whatever flies more from their home airport. I prefer United cause I mostly fly from O'Hare. I'd probably prefer Delta if I was in Atlanta or something"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-18-2021 07:09 PM] Schmitty: Delta doesn't do the unbundling but yeah, I think that's right. There's some minor variation in customer service etc. but at some point they're tied by available tickets, takeoff slots, etc."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-18-2021 07:09 PM] Roshan: Virgin differentiates by hiring hot stewardesses"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-18-2021 07:09 PM] Schmitty: Yeah. I was flying AA to Philadelphia and fly United to Chicago and Delta to Minneapolis."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-18-2021 07:09 PM] Krishnan: The best airline tho is Qatar"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-18-2021 07:09 PM] Schmitty: Yeah"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-18-2021 07:09 PM] Roshan: Iceland used to subsidize WOW airline flights to Iceland so they could boost tourism."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-18-2021 07:09 PM] Matt: Once they stopped, WOW folded"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-18-2021 07:09 PM] Roshan: Yeah in a blaze of glory too. They shut down literally in the middle of their flights, people got stranded"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-18-2021 07:09 PM] Schmitty: Yeah. That saga was fucked. Literally left flight attendants overseas and weren't going to pay for them to get home"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-18-2021 07:09 PM] Krishnan: Wow didn't really have much to offer beyond that Iceland deal tho"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-18-2021 07:09 PM] Matt: Southwest prioritizes customer service, so you don't get change fees. Your money is good for a year and you just update at current prices"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-18-2021 07:09 PM] Jonas: Yeah I like Southwest. They fly out of Burbank which is right next to me"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-18-2021 07:09 PM] Matt: For business, I'll fly delta, AA, or United. I'm not paying the fees if someone fucks up"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-18-2021 07:09 PM] Matt: They also play nice with each other over delays. They'll rebook you between those three no problem"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-18-2021 07:09 PM] Matt: SW is not in that cartel"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-18-2021 07:09 PM] Schmitty: The treating the plane like a greyhound bus when making a connection is a little weird"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-18-2021 07:09 PM] Krishnan: I honestly never fly Southwest, Midway is just kinda inconvenient for me"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-18-2021 07:09 PM] Roshan: A lot of major airlines focus on loyalty programs and perks, which I think is sort of a way of confusing people with math so they can’t really decide what the best option is"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-18-2021 07:09 PM] Roshan: “Earning miles” is probably the only innovation airlines have had since the 70s. Maybe in-flight WiFi counts"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-18-2021 07:09 PM] Roshan: Airplanes were actually somehow better in the 70s. People could stand up and walk around, it was more like a lounge than a prison bus"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-18-2021 07:09 PM] Krishnan: And airports are so much of a worse experience too post-9/11"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-18-2021 07:09 PM] Schmitty: Lol. Yeah. I just meant, going back to 1979. I had this impression that in the 70's airfares were still like 1-2k inflation adjusted"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-18-2021 07:09 PM] Max: Unless they buy from Airbus"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-18-2021 07:09 PM] Max: Got to smoke too"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-18-2021 07:09 PM] Max: Southwest has the best model for casual travelers going shorter routes. Business travel is a different ball game"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-18-2021 07:09 PM] Max: But there's a reason SWA is the only airline that hasn't gone bankrupt or been unprofitable (unsure if COVID bucked the profitability situation)"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-18-2021 07:09 PM] Schmitty: Best model for the company at least. The refundability is nice for consumers. But, most times I've looked the itineraries are suboptimal relative to others, assuming you're willing to pay a small price premium."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-18-2021 07:09 PM] Max: Definitely true cross-country or not their main routes. Hence why I flew JetBlue to/from Boston. I always fly United for work because they're the only non-stop from San Diego to DC"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-18-2021 07:09 PM] Schmitty: How so? If it functioned correctly the first time, that seems to suggest the likelihood of failure is less the second time. There were unknowns the first time that are know known, changing the probability."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-20-2021 10:18 AM] Max: Fuck even most 20 year olds that test positive were like \"I guess I had a runny nose\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-20-2021 10:18 AM] Jonas: Covid does affect kids"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-20-2021 10:18 AM] Jonas: Rarely do they get very sick"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-20-2021 10:18 AM] Jonas: But they do"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-20-2021 10:18 AM] Max: Kids are always sick so it's probably viewed as no change"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-20-2021 10:18 AM] Jonas: In January our ICU was full"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-20-2021 10:18 AM] Schmitty: Right and if delta is more transmissible amongst kids, they may still be at pretty low risk but the absolute numbers are going to be much bigger"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-20-2021 10:18 AM] Schmitty: Which is why I was asking if anyone had analyzed the data about that"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-20-2021 10:18 AM] Schmitty: May be hard to tell since prevalence has been really low until recently"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-20-2021 10:18 AM] Jonas: Haven't seen any amongst delta in children yet."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-20-2021 10:18 AM] Matt: Well it's the testing that results in all those positive cases"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-20-2021 10:18 AM] Max: I actually wanted to ask about this, why aren't the vaccines currently approved for children?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-20-2021 10:18 AM] Schmitty: They weren’t in the trials"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-20-2021 10:18 AM] Schmitty: But are in a current one"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-20-2021 10:18 AM] Max: Also not wrong"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-20-2021 10:18 AM] Jonas: Current thought is by late summer early fall will be approved under 12"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-20-2021 10:18 AM] Schmitty: So estimates are this fall Pfizer will likely be approved for 2+"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-20-2021 10:18 AM] Matt: Whore logic"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-20-2021 10:18 AM] Jonas: But probably not under 2"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-20-2021 10:18 AM] Jonas: Lol"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-20-2021 10:18 AM] Max: Ok cool. What's the autism rate though?"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-20-2021 10:18 AM] Schmitty: 💯"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-20-2021 10:18 AM] Krishnan: No evidence specifically like that but I saw somewhere that roughly 20% of new cases over the last month were kids"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-20-2021 10:18 AM] Matt: Up 20%. Great work!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-20-2021 10:18 AM] Matt: Shit. Should have used reply. Meant to say autism was up 20% with the new vaccine"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-20-2021 10:18 AM] Schmitty: Damn. Yeah. That’s a little scary. More kids start dying and I think it’ll really change attitudes"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-20-2021 10:18 AM] Schmitty: Even if they can successfully message that *adults* should get the vaccine to help kids. It becomes an easier choice"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-20-2021 10:18 AM] Krishnan: In fairness, it's likely cause a larger proportion of other age groups are vaxxed"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-20-2021 10:18 AM] Max: Absolutely. That's why nobody gave a fuck in the beginning. People care when kids die"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-20-2021 10:18 AM] Matt: How many kids have died? We're talking like they rarely ever get severe symptoms"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-20-2021 10:18 AM] Schmitty: Oh definitely but still. It’s perception"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-20-2021 10:18 AM] Max: Significantly less % than old fat people"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-20-2021 10:18 AM] Schmitty: That was in reply to Krishnan"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-20-2021 10:18 AM] Schmitty: They’re the worst though"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-20-2021 10:18 AM] Matt: And people are revenge- socializing"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-20-2021 10:18 AM] Schmitty: Generally, not just for Covid"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-20-2021 10:18 AM] Matt: Fucking hermits out there making friends for the first time"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-20-2021 10:18 AM] Matt: My company has been turning \"getting back to work\" into a party."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-20-2021 10:18 AM] Matt: I hate it"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-20-2021 10:18 AM] Max: I feel bad for kids that aren't in daycare or some form of socialising because the last year would definitely have a huge negative effect in that regard"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-20-2021 10:18 AM] Matt: No cool toilet seats anywhere"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-20-2021 10:18 AM] Jonas: Lucy is in daycare and all she had done is brought home colds constantly"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-20-2021 10:18 AM] Max: Yeah now that I have a bidet at home pooping at work isn't the same"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-20-2021 10:18 AM] Krishnan: Data from AAP"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-20-2021 10:18 AM] Max: What about self reported deaths in VAERS"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-20-2021 10:18 AM] Matt: In the last two weeks i went from a private 500 square foot throne room to a warm seat and shoes under every barrier"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-20-2021 10:18 AM] Schmitty: That’s only like 1500 kids"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-20-2021 10:18 AM] Schmitty: Not enough dead kids"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-20-2021 10:18 AM] Krishnan: And roughly 1-2% of pediatric cases result in hospitalization. Worth noting that there are other bad outcomes besides death and we have equally little data on long term effects of having covid in kids"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-20-2021 10:18 AM] Schmitty: That’s a lot of other peoples’ poop particles floating around you"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-20-2021 10:18 AM] Schmitty: Yeah. That’s a weird part of that point of debate to me. The presumption that the vaccine is somewhat likely to likely to have negative long term effects but that Covid isn’t."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-20-2021 10:18 AM] Schmitty: Yeah, the school/daycare thing was pretty botched from the beginning, or at least not handled in an unbiased way. At least the CDC isn't showing signs of drastically revising its guidance in light of the increase in prevalence of delta."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-20-2021 10:18 AM] Jonas: I had a fever 6 months post vaccine. Should I put that in VAERS?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-20-2021 10:18 AM] Matt: Count it!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-20-2021 10:18 AM] Schmitty: Look. We're just asking questions. Who's to say they aren't related?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-20-2021 10:18 AM] Krishnan: I had a headache, fatigue and mild nausea on Sunday. Probably the vaccine and not the several cocktails I had."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-20-2021 10:18 AM] Krishnan: Best way to handle it would be to make the vax mandatory for attending school once it's approved, same way we do with all those other vaccines"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-20-2021 10:18 AM] Matt: Time to report weak erections and premature ejaculation..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-20-2021 10:18 AM] Krishnan: that was pure Joe bait"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-20-2021 10:18 AM] Schmitty: Yeah. I also meant that the developmental issues from the school shutdowns were significantly and, I don’t think, appropriately weighed against the risks of Covid to children."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-20-2021 10:18 AM] Matt: Has Joe ever baited you?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-20-2021 10:18 AM] Krishnan: I wish"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-20-2021 10:18 AM] Krishnan: No honestly, he might be. Like when he posts something egregiously dumb, maybe he's just triggering me"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-20-2021 10:18 AM] Schmitty: Yeah. I've thought that's possible"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-20-2021 10:18 AM] Schmitty: Some of it seems... intentional"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-20-2021 10:18 AM] Matt: I was being a little more generous with the use of the term \"baited\". You know... \"bated"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-20-2021 10:18 AM] Matt: He tried to 'bate me one time at Krishnan and Roshan's apartment"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-20-2021 10:18 AM] Roshan: That was the origin of the Sloppy Joe nickname. Fun night"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-20-2021 10:18 AM] Jonas: I'm pretty sure I was there as well"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-20-2021 10:18 AM] Jonas: Somehow"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-20-2021 10:18 AM] Krishnan: We all know what you meant. Same thing you always mean"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-20-2021 10:18 AM] Krishnan: That was the time he tried to drink spilled beer off the beer pong table right?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-20-2021 10:18 AM] Jonas: Yep."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-20-2021 10:18 AM] Jonas: Gotta get that keystone"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-20-2021 10:18 AM] Schmitty: It was like instantaneous. Was it really just Murdoch being like \"now we're all going to say the vaccine is good\"?"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-20-2021 10:18 AM] Jonas: Yeah we need the second part Carter"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-20-2021 10:18 AM] Matt: He's an advocate for taking the training wheels off the country that isn't as abrasive as trump. Someone with the potential to remove functions of government without being a provocateur"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-20-2021 10:18 AM] Jonas: just ate two chick fil a sandwiches and I'm very full and don't feel great. Never happened to me before. Am I getting old."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-21-2021 08:17 PM] Roshan: I think they’re saying it was a part of his bit for the olympics so he hasn’t said it yet, but now I really wonder what it was"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-29-2021 08:31 AM] Joe: I'm just saying, it's ridiculous to keep fueling this fear campaign.

{"prompt":"","completion":"[07-29-2021 08:31 AM] Krishnan: The focus on breakthrough infections is so dumb, at least for now. The real issue is vaccine hesitancy and a focus on breakthrough infections on the media probably worsens that"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-04-2021 05:56 PM] Joe: Also, doesn't operation mockingbird make you a little suspicious about everything the mainstream puts out? In my opinion almost everything in the mainstream media is full of distortions, lies, and half truths in order to create their narratives. Obviously you guys don't see it, and probably think I'm a nut, but once you see it you can't unsee it."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-04-2021 05:56 PM] Roshan: Distort it relative to what though?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-04-2021 05:56 PM] Schmitty: Sure but your impression of the “distortion” is based on your own biases (as is everyone’s)"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-04-2021 05:56 PM] Krishnan: Yeah I think these alternative media sites often have just as much if not more of a bias and distortions than mainstream media"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-04-2021 05:56 PM] Joe: Yeah but at least most of the alternative media sites are openly either conservative or liberal. And there's nothing wrong with giving the news with a conservative/liberal bent if you are open about it. It's when institutions claiming to be unbiased \"journalist\" inject left wing talking points into the stories while still insisting on being neutral."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-04-2021 05:56 PM] Schmitty: I agree with you that more journalism should drop the pretense but I think it’s odd to claim that it’s somehow worse just because there is a pretense"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-04-2021 05:56 PM] Schmitty: The bias is there whether it’s “labeled” or not"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-04-2021 05:56 PM] Matt: I think you all know I've got that bad wolf taxidermy in my mind"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-04-2021 05:56 PM] Max: That's why I don't watch nor read the news. I go outside"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-10-2021 07:00 PM] Schmitty: Yeah. It really sucks that it’s so easy to make it much less of an issue but people aren’t willing to take that step"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-10-2021 07:00 PM] Schmitty: Maybe that was part of the reason Joe’s vaccine tone was different last week? Like saying high risk people should get it etc."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-11-2021 08:13 PM] Schmitty: Yeah. But yet he’s been reading the group chat"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-11-2021 08:13 PM] Matt: Why?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-11-2021 08:13 PM] Roshan: We spent $800B on the Iraq war, couldn’t we have just given it to the Taliban instead? There’s no rich terrorist"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-11-2021 08:13 PM] Schmitty: Hard to guess at what’s really going on"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-11-2021 08:13 PM] Krishnan: Was that what we were doing?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-11-2021 08:13 PM] Matt: The horse ivermectin is working"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-11-2021 08:13 PM] Max: Weren't letting the Taliban win that's for sure"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-11-2021 08:13 PM] Krishnan: Our presence there spawned new Taliban on a daily basis"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-11-2021 08:13 PM] Max: They would've spent it on Virgins and wanted more"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-11-2021 08:13 PM] Max: Those damn soldiers getting those Taliban women pregante again"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-11-2021 08:13 PM] Max: Yeah actually he has read some of the chat since I started this afternoon"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-11-2021 08:13 PM] Max: That's Prego"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-11-2021 08:13 PM] Jonas: Did the release the ivermectin trial?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-11-2021 08:13 PM] Schmitty: No, Rachel's prego. The sauce is Ragu"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-11-2021 08:13 PM] Matt: No, Raghu Echempati is a professor at Kettering University. You're thinking of Classico"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-11-2021 08:13 PM] Krishnan: Sort of. The data hasn't been released or peer reviewed but it's about to be presented and it's apparently negative for any benefit"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-11-2021 08:13 PM] Schmitty: Even for being dumb?"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-13-2021 09:34 PM] Roshan: For $15k? There’s probably bigger fish to fry"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-13-2021 09:34 PM] Krishnan: You're probably right but the scope is kinda irrelevant to me, it shouldn't be legal for 15k or like pelosi making millions"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-13-2021 09:34 PM] Schmitty: Yeah. No reason to have it hinge on a threshold amount."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-13-2021 09:34 PM] Schmitty: It’s also problematic, despite the small amount, that it took over a year for him to make the disclosure"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-13-2021 09:34 PM] Schmitty: It’s supposedly the only individual stock they’ve bought in forever. Not like they just forgot it from some laundry list"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-13-2021 09:34 PM] Roshan: What would the law be? He bought the shares after Joe bought a bunch of masks, there was already a lot of public knowledge already"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-13-2021 09:34 PM] Krishnan: Congresspeople and their spouses should be barred from trading individual stocks altogether while they're in office"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-13-2021 09:34 PM] Roshan: Can they have any type of IRA or retirement account? Or they can’t even indirectly invest?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-13-2021 09:34 PM] Roshan: Keep in mind Peter Thiel has an IRA that investments in his own companies, with no active management on his part of course"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-13-2021 09:34 PM] Schmitty: Well, they could give them the option that presidents before Trump used."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-13-2021 09:34 PM] Roshan: But then banning retirement accounts seems extreme"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-13-2021 09:34 PM] Krishnan: Individual stocks. Funds and shit would be fine"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-13-2021 09:34 PM] Schmitty: You can either put everything in a independently controlled trust whose management you don't have substantial contact with and have to disclose any insubstantial contact or you can can control it and can't trade individual stocks"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-13-2021 09:34 PM] Schmitty: Yeah. I don't think the type of account has any bearing. It's what the securities are. They can invest in ETFs, mutual funds, and the like"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-13-2021 09:34 PM] Roshan: I wonder how the really rich ones siphon money from the government though"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-13-2021 09:34 PM] Roshan: Most of these congressman inside trading things are really small amounts of money, like tens or hundreds of thousands at most"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-13-2021 09:34 PM] Roshan: We spend $2T a year, there’s gotta be some bigger rackets going on"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-13-2021 09:34 PM] Krishnan: you're probably right that there are, but it doesn't mean this isn't something that should be fixed"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-13-2021 09:34 PM] Matt: Awarding contracts"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-13-2021 09:34 PM] Matt: So then to combat corruption in awarding contracts, they'll establish redundant watchdog agencies and protocols, the inefficiencies of which we also pay for"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-13-2021 09:34 PM] Matt: In which year did we only spend 2 trillion?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-13-2021 09:34 PM] Schmitty: I actually don't know how much of that other stuff happens. A lot of people in Congress who are really rich either were before they came (e.g., Romney) or they're just trading off their name to get access to opportunities"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-13-2021 09:34 PM] Schmitty: Not necessarily taking from the government"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-13-2021 09:34 PM] Matt: Well they can approve something that will have a fairly obvious beneficiary and then find themselves funded for life because of it"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-13-2021 09:34 PM] Matt: Say i approve a bill allowing emissions exceptions for oil and gas operators on leased land, now i eat nothing but steak and caviar during my whole campaign and end up with a lobbyist gig for huge sums of money after I'm out of office"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-13-2021 09:34 PM] Schmitty: Is there a more technical name for a house-shaped pentagon?"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-13-2021 09:34 PM] Roshan: I like this fun fact"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-13-2021 09:34 PM] Roshan: Every baseball game is invalid"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-13-2021 09:34 PM] Jonas: Two negative tests. No Rona for me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-13-2021 09:34 PM] Krishnan: Surbhis tested negative four times since I was diagnosed"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-13-2021 09:34 PM] Matt: Does that prove it's not transmitted through semen?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-13-2021 09:34 PM] Jonas: Or that the vaccine is stronger than his semen."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-13-2021 09:34 PM] Krishnan: The fact that Jonas is negative does"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-13-2021 09:34 PM] Jonas: I did the saliva test yesterday. Never again."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-13-2021 09:34 PM] Schmitty: Never again?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-13-2021 09:34 PM] Krishnan: Saliva test sucks. It's so much saliva"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-13-2021 09:34 PM] Jonas: It's only 3ml but feels like a gallon"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-13-2021 09:34 PM] Schmitty: Ah"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-13-2021 09:34 PM] Jonas: I sat there for 5 min spitting into this tube with the dryest mouth in the world."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-13-2021 09:34 PM] Krishnan: I did saliva last Thursday too. There is nothing that makes your mouth dryer than knowing you have to produce a shit load of spit"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-13-2021 09:34 PM] Schmitty: Is it a better test than nasal or is there some other reason you wouldn’t just do that?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-13-2021 09:34 PM] Jonas: Not from what I've seen. It's more comfortable.."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-13-2021 09:34 PM] Krishnan: That's just the test they had at the place I went"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-13-2021 09:34 PM] Max: Who knew that semen gave you dry mouth"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-13-2021 09:34 PM] Roshan: The nasal swabs hurt so bad, I hated them"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-13-2021 09:34 PM] Roshan: I felt like they were poking my brain"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-13-2021 09:34 PM] Krishnan: they're way more shallow now"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-13-2021 09:34 PM] Krishnan: But the home tests go just as deep if not deeper"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-13-2021 09:34 PM] Jonas: Yeah the last one I did I barely cried"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-13-2021 09:34 PM] Schmitty: That’s interesting. I didn’t know that. I’ve only ever gone to a testing center (though haven’t in a long while) and the current amount of penetration is fine"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-13-2021 09:34 PM] Schmitty: Light penetration"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-13-2021 09:34 PM] Jonas: Max are you day drunk again"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-13-2021 09:34 PM] Roshan: The real irony here is that he’s a libertarian and would have made more money on Bitcoin"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-13-2021 09:34 PM] Schmitty: Well, he says he’s a libertarian but he’s pretty much a non-interventionist conservative"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-13-2021 09:34 PM] Schmitty: I didn’t get Max’s comment or why it would mean he was day drunk and then I saw the other chat"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-13-2021 09:34 PM] Schmitty: Regeneron is a big client so I think I’m legally obligated to say that you should take as much Regeneron as you can"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-14-2021 11:15 PM] Joe: Honestly, Trista is a killer nurse. She came and visited on Thursday night and that was a big turn around. She really pushed me on the breathing exercises and stressed how much I needed to get all that garbage out of my lungs. The actual nurses did a piss poor job of explaining all of that stuff and I was just essentially just dicking around with the incentive spirometer before not doing much good."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-14-2021 11:15 PM] Schmitty: I can imagine. Sara was in recovery for like 4 days after her bowel resection and even just visiting for those four days felt like a super long time"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-15-2021 06:00 PM] Roshan: I’m willing to drop a flex or two but I liked the superflex, it actually wasn’t a given to play a  third QB every week with our PPR rules"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-16-2021 10:29 AM] Joe: I know this isn't the best segue, but if you ever want to hear a serious, non-dogmatic explanation about God that you've probably never contemplated, let me know. It's good stuff once the light bulb goes on and you view the topic through a different lens. I'll be the first to acknowledge that the evangelical Christian types are one of the biggest roadblocks in the way for scientifically minded people to believing in God. Also, God has a man in the sky type figure is absolute bullshit and is in all intense and purposes a straw man that makes people like yourself look down on believers. Hopefully someday I might be able to help open some of your eyes in some way shape or form on this topic. 🙏🏻"}

But the way this all went down so fast and so catastrophically badly really has me at a loss for words. Are our military leaders truly that inept?"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-16-2021 10:29 AM] Schmitty: I agree but I'd say there was never really anything to win. The goals of taking out OBL and al Qaeda were clear and we accomplished those.

I lost some under foliage and leaves because of this however it’s been good since then.

{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-18-2021 08:24 AM] Jonas: Pruning time for all of bonsai is in September. You don’t want to prune or pinch to early with the new growth because you will stop growth of that branch and won't be healthy"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-18-2021 08:24 AM] Jonas: Lots of things can become a bonsai. The biggest thing is it just requires a special substrate to be grounded as well as consistent watering schedule. Bonsai actually means trea in pot. So it needs that as well"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-18-2021 08:24 AM] Jonas: My guess if they are talking about I’m missing a good chunk of season is there doing more than just a decompression. I’ve seen people back to full speed in about 2 to 3 weeks after those"}

Meanwhile she gets admitted to picu in compensated septic shock and has a huuuuge periosteal abscess. So when i randomly work up at 4 am I looked it up myself and saw she was crumping. I called and woke him up to take this girl to surgery right then..."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:15 AM] Schmitty: I mean this is for visitors. No reason you should be able to get by with a two day old test. You want to visit in person? Be vaccinated or get a dose in person then"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:15 AM] Schmitty: Yeah. I understand that but it takes <2 min to get a dose. And if you really want you can be a little lax on enforcement for true end of life situations"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Schmitty: That's a reasonable reason to doubt actual gene therapy but it's not like any part of any actual vaccine remains in your body for any appreciate length of time relative to that time horizon"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Schmitty: But that's the point. You can't prove there's a realistic non-zero probability of long term effects of a vaccine using an analogy, let alone one that only holds on the generalities"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Matt: What about what you've said is proof there can't be long term effects? Refuting my argument doesn't make yours right"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Schmitty: I'm saying there's no scientific evidence there would be anything close to a widespread long term effect. Everything we know about vaccines generally says that we should already see at least some indication of adverse effects if they were going to show up. Your rebuttal just now is asking me to prove a negative, which I obviously can't do. I'm not saying it's impossible, just that there's no reason to believe there would be."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Schmitty: Yeah"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Matt: Is it just lawyer shit to use negatives at every opportunity?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Schmitty: Lol. Well considering that what happened is that SCOTUS *didn’t* do something, the negative is appropriate"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Schmitty: To use active tense"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Max: A not the 49 states that aren't Texas anti-life ban didn't get not unstayed by all the courts that aren't not SCOTUS"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Matt: Extrapolating from freakonomics, children who would have been aborted will probably vote Democrat"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Max: Touche"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Matt: Texas has a different outlook on that. They call it \"good guy with a gun\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Matt: As much as \"good guy with a gun\" is basically trash, i believe there's credence to \"potential bad guy who's pretty sure everyone in the room is armed\""}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Max: I do buy into that some. You'd fuck with less people if you knew they also had a gun"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Max: Yeah it's more \"bad guy not going to knowingly pick a fair or even unfair fight\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Schmitty: If you got mad at how I wrote that sentence, you’d be pissed to learn how some judges handle statutory interpretation"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Matt: So glad you had this queued up"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Schmitty: I had to scroll through my photos for a minute but I don't have that many and the preview frame is so obvious as to what it is. The dog would do that for a while, like 30-40 min and then stop."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Schmitty: It didn't bother me because you couldn't hear it with the door closed but it was good for a laugh if you went into the hall and it was going on"}

In fact, I'm pretty close to 100% recovered and feeling better than ever actually. I'm just taking this time to do a total life reset and haven't been on any social media or paying attention to just about anything online (as evidenced by the fact that I haven't been involved in our Signal chat haha.)\n\nI look forward to sharing my whole story with you guys at your wedding though. It was one heck of a roller coast ride with tons of twists and turns and actually makes for a pretty crazy story.\n\nHow did everything go at your bachelor party? Did you all have a good time?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Schmitty: Great. Glad you're feeling better! Also glad to hear that you'll be able to make the wedding. Will it be all three of you (just trying to finalize numbers)? It was a very good weekend. Went for a long hike on Saturday and otherwise just sort of hung around and joked about. It was good to get away for a weekend - I hadn't been to the Adirondacks in almost two years."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Schmitty: Joe is alive and... maybe a changed man?"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Matt: I like this"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Schmitty: What if Joe's big new lease on life is just that he doesn't think hyperinflation is going to happen now?"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Joe: Unfortunately I can't talk Trista into bringing Summer with/coming, so it will just be me. \n\nI'm glad you had a great weekend out there.

{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Schmitty: No worries. That's been the case for a lot of people. Our friend is coming but the spouse/partner is unable to make it. Jonas is coming without Bo or Lucy."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Matt: I'm sure it starts with a zero-low media diet"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Roshan: But what instigated the reset? He found god already didn’t he? Did he just find god again?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Matt: He nearly died from going down a 4-year hard- right rabbit hole and made owning libs his life's work"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Jonas: maybe he is going thrbmax approach. Hates liberals and liberal ideals but hates hard right more. So he's just angry"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Jonas: The Max*"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Matt: I'm hoping for a more gentle, corrective conservative Joe. Not that he got to \"fuck your feelings\" levels of cocksucker, but just not so damn reactive and argumentative."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Matt: Also... same."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Matt: Unrelated: one of the unspoken nuisances of parenthood: picking up a thermometer and wondering \"has this been in a butthole?\""}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Matt: Exactly! Your options are 1. suck it up, clean it, and take your chances or 2. Stuff it up your own butt"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Matt: So i just won't know whether I'm running a fever, i guess."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Jonas: Either of those options are fine."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Roshan: On second thought, it’s kind of a wild card thing to have a life reset so I’m hopeful the group dynamic won’t change much"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Max: Just by not being on social media he's already more down my path of righteousness"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Roshan: You should start a cult"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Max: I hope we start 0-whatever it takes to get rid of Nagy"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Max: A harder game is probably who's the best coach post Ditka"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Schmitty: Even I remember some insanely odd choices of when to take a time out"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Schmitty: /not take a time out"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Max: We were up against Atlanta, Lovie decided to pooch it with less than 2 minutes left in the game giving them great field position. Guess what, we lost with 30 seconds left"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Matt: At 4:1 and a rate parents can stomach, a single teacher can book ~$1200/week. As a lawyer, you book that in 2-6 hours?"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Schmitty: Right but if the daycare has 28 kids at it, the excess over wages is 7*$600/wk"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Schmitty: And that’s assuming you’re paying the workers $15 an hour (when the average is apparently ~$12.5) and using your $1200 monthly rate."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Max: Travelers are just people who hop around?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Jonas: Yeah. Usually through an agency"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Max: I dunno... Look at how many times we've almost/actually fucked up the chats. 100% chance of Frank doing it."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Matt: So elusive"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Schmitty: Yeah. He had an unspecified “family emergency”"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Matt: HIPPA violation to tell a friend why"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Matt: Man i hope it wasn't a dreaded ingrown toenail"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Max: Might have been. Schmitty didn't advertise that God was going to be a part of the service so Trista blocked the trip"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Roshan: I like this theory"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Schmitty: Trista already wasn’t coming"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Schmitty: But she probably does hold sway over Joe"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Schmitty: Honestly, we didn’t plan for it to be that religious."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Schmitty: But my godfather is very religious and it was really important to me for him to do the ceremony"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Schmitty: So after that we just sort of let him have free reign. I did not expect to have any prayer, let alone two, but oh well"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Schmitty: Doesn’t bother me. Just unexpected"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Jonas: DOUBLE PRAYER"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Max: Well I don't know how the ceremony was at all because my kid is a dick"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Max: As a reference point over the last 12 hours he's gone potty twice, aka the same number of times he made me take him during the 20 minute ceremony"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Matt: Great comment, btw"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Matt: I'm the spirit of things we don't acknowledge in front of Joe, anyone else notice that you can only get at-home covid tests from 3 retailers now?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Matt: Our meijer used to carry them. The pharmacist told Emily yesterday to stop wasting her time. Only Amazon, Walmart, and Walgreens are getting them"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Matt: I recall an early coronavirus presser where Pence had all the corporate partners step forward. Walgreens was part of that. Sounds like there's cronie capitalism going on here."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Schmitty: What I've seen is that supposedly there's just not many out there because there's generally low demand for them from customers trying to get them at private retailers"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Matt: Walgreens will let you order them at normal prices. Amazon is higher. Never checked Walmart"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Matt: I recall seeing that sales slumped with initial vaccination rollout, abbott slowed/stopped production, delta swept the world, and now there's a consistent supply shortage"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Schmitty: That sounds right. What I had seen was maybe discussing that they didn’t expect any demand increase to be enough to justify amping production significantly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Max: Along a similar vane, we just got notification of the vaccine mandate meaning everyone at NG has to get their last dose NLT Nov 24"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Max: Obviously I'm pro vaccine but this feels a little unconstitutional"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Schmitty: Right to work, babyyyy"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Max: Government pulled this stunt knowing anti vaxxers are also anti Union. Well played Biden maybe you still got it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Schmitty: Wait, right to work is anti-government"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Max: Oh I misread the shit out of that"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Schmitty: Lol. Yeah. It's specifically because the law doesn't step in to protect workers that companies can fire you for not getting a vaccine"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Schmitty: Just funny that right to work was a big anti-union push that worked and now a subset of those same people don't like the results because they have to get vaccinated"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Max: So much for your super immunity"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Krishnan: I don't necessarily know how it's unconstitutional tho. There's nothing in the Constitution that says you can't mandate vaccines. seems to fit within OSHA"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Krishnan: Well now I have both natural and vaccine immunity. I'm basically indestructible"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Matt: You've already proven your shit's weak by getting a breakthrough infection"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Matt: I don't think the constitution explicitly addressed inoculation, but it's fair to say that our government was founded on being anti-government"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Matt: The spirit of it all was \"fuck you. You can't tell me what to do\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Matt: But then as government added services, they can control access. Driving privileges, schools..."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Matt: Spoken like a proper demonrat"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Max: But I feel like the government shouldn't be able to mandate something like a vaccine that will lead to people losing their jobs"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Max: Although I personally would love to work for a company that has less than 100 people"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Matt: It moves faster and more falls on your shoulders. Usually the balance of R&D vs revenue is out of whack so there's never any fucking money"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Max: Yeah so they can't afford to have an 80% useless workforce like us big boys"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Roshan: Going from a 70 to 8 person company, it is kind of nice how much you can slack off when most of the workforce is useless too"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Schmitty: It’s not unconstitutional. It might be if it was a federal mandate, depending on how it’s structured. But statewide vaccine mandates are clearly constitutional (as part of the “police powers”) and federal mandates for contractors/federal employees are clearly constitutional as well since there’s no limit on tying strings to federal funds."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Max: It is a federal mandate"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Schmitty: Not really"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Schmitty: It’s vaccine or test"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Max: And then they limit the supply of tests so you can't get tested"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Schmitty: I agree with that part that the government should do more to promote availability of tests"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Schmitty: Lol. It’s really callously phrased but doesn’t seem to be something to worry about. Like companies aren’t going to pass up on making billions of dollars even if the product that does that “ends” or severely diminishes the market."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Krishnan: That's fair but the point is there are some diseases with cures that aren't available because they're unprofitable"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Schmitty: Yeah. I think the difference is it was actually commercialized (unsuccessfully), so the remedy should be targeted based on what actually happened."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Schmitty: Like a compulsory patent license for non-commercialization of a successful clinic candidate after X years may be appropriate"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Schmitty: I also don’t know the specifics of that case that well. Maybe Canada is fucking up on the orphan drug front. The US has somewhat good legislation to promote them but it’s mostly carrots when there could/should be more sticks also"}

Using median home size of housing inventory of the boroughs and populations weighting them, you get 729 sq ft vs. 1280 sq ft for SF, which makes the price per square foot to be $1138 for SF and $1095 for NY. So Matt was mostly right, the difference is mostly accounted for in size. The data seem odd for Queens though. It shows a median home size of 545 sq ft whereas even Manhattan is still 720 sq ft, which could be believable but weirdly there aren't any data before April 2020, unlike the other boroughs."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Schmitty: Even that could be doubtful. If for example it was a blank that just went stray and no one particularly told the woman who died to stand where she was standing then it might just be purely accidental so everyone acted “reasonably”"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Schmitty: If the convention is specialist maintains the gun and actor fires where and when told then negligence on the actor’s part is going to be hard to prove"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Schmitty: Yeah. They really should just use an air soft gun and add in muzzle effects in post"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Krishnan: I mean I feel like they'd say that an actor handed a gun as part of filming a movie while on set would #reasonably 👆🏿 expect it to be safe to fire"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Schmitty: Best argument for Baldwin’s criminal/civil liability is something like, regardless of what system is in place, anyone holding a gun knows they shouldn’t fire towards someone else even with a blank because a gun is so inherently dangerous and so it’s unreasonable to have fired it how he did. Best (and in my non-legal opinion better) counter is that (a) guns are inherently dangerous so the deceased/injured assumed the risk by being on set during filming where it would be discharged and (b) Baldwin only discharged the gun in the manner in which he was instructed and therefore he acted reasonably in the circumstances (which he could separately use to try to argue any liability he would have should transfer to his employer)."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Matt: On an unrelated note, my doctor's office is complete shit at answering phones and scheduling appointments, but it's right next to my house. I sat on hold the entire commute home then just walked in and scheduled an appointment"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Matt: It's really not difficult to check the barrel for obstructions yourself"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Schmitty: Yeah. But the legal theory rests on whether he had a duty to do that or not. Arguably in the circumstances he didn't, it was the duty of the prop supervisor."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Krishnan: But it's reasonable to assume that's been done by the people who have the job of making sure a prop is safe to use"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Krishnan: I said nothing about being a good lawyer"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Schmitty: Negligence requires you establish a duty of care first even before you question reasonableness in discharging the duty. Based on what we know right now, Baldwin could challenge both prongs"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Schmitty: (One of the duties is literally \"duty of care of a reasonable person.\" haha. But what that is is context dependent. It's reasonable care in the context of the situation, which might simply be that Baldwin asked the prop supervisor \"is this gun good to fire?\" or maybe even just only handled guns given to him by the supervisor without any further questions/checks)"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Schmitty: Lol. Well currently they’re centering on a requirement that childcare providers be paid teachers’ wages with a subsidy for lower income earners to help afford it but the subsidy has a drop off (not phase out) that’s currently at 100-130% of median income by state for the first three years (before there being no drop off)"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Schmitty: But it looks like the drop off is headed towards being indefinitely capped at 200% or 150% of median household income"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Schmitty: Yeah. I'm a single issue voter and my issue is that someone of moderately high income can't get even one $300 payment from the government ever because otherwise society will collapse"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Matt: Day care teacher wages are in price discovery right now because it's a fairly demanding job that pays poorly. The labor market was handling their wages at least"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Schmitty: Yeah. Idk. The universal pre-k debate was so weirdly focused on child outcomes, which appear to not be affected by participation much based on recent research, when there's been no focus on allowing parents to work. Conservatives are so obsessed with people working and then don't pay any attention to barriers to that goal"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Schmitty: To that end, providing a subsidy makes sense. Requiring some wage floor vs. just letting the subsidy act to provide wage pressure is debatable - I don't really have an opinion"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Max: Shit if I was on set filming and someone told me they handed a cold gun I would also assume it was cold. Except I work with a bunch of people who don't do their job so I know better"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Schmitty: Supposedly some of the prop people really wanted to fire the antique guns and so had took them out shooting and then someone some of the live ammo carried over onto set, or something along those lines"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Matt: That's also ill-advised. At some point you just call a gun a \"wall hanger\" because it's so old that you can't trust it to hold up to the pressures anymore. My dad has a beautiful double barrel 10 ga shotgun that he has never nor will never fire because it was built when barrels were built by hammering sheet steel around a dowel"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Matt: Any given ammunition specifies the pressure it's loaded to generate from the beginning, so antique weapons fired with modern ammunition should still fire at the same pressures it was built for, but they still weren't made with modern manufacturing techniques"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Schmitty: The latter point is fair but the European “debt crisis” was mostly hype or not actually about the debt. In any case, austerity didn’t work to fix the problem"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Schmitty: MMT does get weirdly hung up on the dogma that taxes don’t pay for anything when it should be more like taxes don’t matter in terms of paying for things."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Schmitty: Because we can print money. Our ability to finance government spending is in no way contingent on taxation in an economic (or constitutional) sense."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Roshan: So when the government collects taxes, that doesn’t go into a bank somewhere?"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Schmitty: They do go into accounts and they get spent!"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Schmitty: Which is why the simplistic MMT take is dumb."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Max: Can we just get rid of pennies and maybe even nickels at this point? Like is anything worth less than a dime anymore?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Matt: A penny"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Schmitty: But our ability to spend the money that the taxes covered wasn’t predicated on receiving the taxes"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Schmitty: We could have printed it instead."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Matt: But that devalues the money, which disproportionately affects the have-nots. It's a regressive tax, doubly so because it inflates the dollar value of an asset with a fixed intrinsic value"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Matt: You can argue \"but the money spent by the government can provide for the have-nots\" but that doesn't actually keep the machine moving and providing things in abundance"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Schmitty: MMT recognizes you can’t just flood the system and so counters that taxes are a way to balance the system by taking money out of it. Their counter to my point is that taxes are just receiving back money that the government created in the first place so my critique is invalid but that’s dumb - banks also create money that’s taxed so clearly not all taxes are government originated"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Matt: Money doesn't create goods and services. People and machines do"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Roshan: How does congress create money if only the Fed can do that? I thought the Fed was independent"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Schmitty: It's actually an interesting thread. Land use emissions are a small part of total emissions but there was a huge amount of variability. There are three different main models that showed divergent trends in land use emissions but better satellite data were obtained and now the models are in pretty good agreement and show a 35% decrease in land use emissions instead of an average 35% increase, over the last decade."}

Only time in new hosts creates new variants.

{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Schmitty: Yeah.

{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Schmitty: Because they fail to realize how many other similar mandates we already have that basically no one cares about"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Max: It is a leader's job to inspire people so they want to do things. Not mandate and force them because they're in charge. It wasn't just Trump supporters not getting vaccinated."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Schmitty: The former is definitely true but I don't know that that lends causality to the latter claim. There are still a lot of US workers and regardless, it doesn't negate that a big increase in wages isn't enough to lure in US workers"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Matt: I'm not going to be upset if the net result is that places just put larger, unfinished cuts on shelves"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Roshan: It’s kind of funny actually, it was really bad and then some guy took a boat and noticed the containers were only stacked 2 high so he got the mayor to lift a restriction so they could stack more up"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Matt: I keep reading that there are truckers idling waiting for containers all the time, so I guess the bottleneck is mostly in crane operators? I've also heard that the trailers are just scattered about the country"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Schmitty: The port is still pretty back up but hopefully starting to ease a bit. Some of the problem is that it isn’t that far off capacity but demand for goods is up 10-20% over trend."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:16 AM] Schmitty: I think some of the issue with the trucks is related to rules about how they can store containers"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:17 AM] Schmitty: Exactly. It became cool to LOVE Hamilton and passé to not have seen it and I think that made people take a more extreme attitude about it than the work actually warranted."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:17 AM] Roshan: Well, probably finite for space"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:17 AM] Roshan: Because tomorrow you could double your money supply and increase GDP, but you haven’t actually added any value or progress to the world? That’s how I meant it at least"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:17 AM] Schmitty: So it includes a lot of government spending but I don’t think that makes it meaningless. Yes, the government can “pump” GDP by spending more but even MMTers would agree that there are other mechanisms that constrain spending so it’s not like GDP is just an arbitrary number because the government makes it that way"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:17 AM] Schmitty: Full on communist countries would still have a GDP and measuring its change over time is still indicative of progress because it signifies that the total value created by the society (denominated in currency) is growing"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"[08-19-2021 08:17 AM] Schmitty: But it’s just one convenient way to measure. Not like an end all stat"}
