{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Say it! Say common sense!"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: He is also being very disingenuous about how variants work and while he’s not a virologist, an evo-devo biologist would certainly now how they work. Variants are caused by random mutations. More virus in the world means more opportunity for mutations means more likelihood of dangerous variant. The vaccines do not cause variants. The virus does not “respond” to the vaccine or natural immunity to overcome it (something Weinstein actually said in the Tucker interview)."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: A breakthrough variant is simply a random natural mutation that happens to evade vaccine immunity. The vaccines slow the spread of the virus thus reducing the amount of virus around thus reducing the likelihood of breakthrough variants. Thus, it is intentionally misleading (i.e., false) to say that the vaccines could “cause” breakthrough variants to come about. Nothing about the vaccine makes it more or less likely for such a variant to exist"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Than with unchecked spread (other than the aggregate probability being lower from reduced spread with increased vaccination, but the probability of a given mutation being a breakthrough variant or not is not effected by the vaccine)"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: ￼ Sorry it took me a while to reply to your posts from last night. I definitely appreciate you taking the time to write all of that up but I still don't agree with you assessment that he is intentionally misleading / lying / grifting / etc. Obviously scientists disagree routinely and that is a part of the scientific method, so it's fine if you don't agree with his hypotheses. I just don't think it's fair to say he is a grifter and/or knowingly lying about this stuff in order to make money. From every conversation I have heard with him, while he is certainly a contrarian, he tackles the issue from the standpoint of trying to get to the truth of the matter and trying to help. If anything, speaking out on this topic has cost him a substantial amount of money. (He claims to have lost 1/2 of his income due to YouTube completely demonetizing his channel). \n\nRegarding all of the vaccine mutation hypotheses, it wasn't something I had heard him speak about in depth so I found an interview he did with a virologist / vaccinologist  that goes in depth on the topic. It's actually a really interesting discussion IMO. While it certainly falls into the category of a \"hypothesis\", the argument seems logically coherent and should at least be something worthy of debate. I would try to summarize the hypothesis, but it's a bit complicated and obviously out of my domain of competence, so if you're interested in hearing the full argument give it a listen.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNyAovuUxro"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Found a new pastime. Check reviews on Amazon for (para)military gear, then read the other reviews by the same people and see if they're exactly what you pictured them to be"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I don’t think it should have been demonitized but I also don’t think it’s that big of a deal"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: He still has a huge financial stake in what he says"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: The point is that in order for it to be a \"grift\", he would have to be knowingly lying in order to profit from a situation. I don't think he's doing either."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Amazon suggested an exflitration helmet complete with mount for night vision goggles. I was curious... followed one of the reviewers and it's all truck accessories, slim fast, air fryers, thin blue line, body armor, and bitching about China"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I do think he is knowingly misleading in the way he presents information"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Really filled in the picture of a live ammunition LARPer struggling with his weight"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: in order to play to his subscribers."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Part of it being that he appears to play fair by giving platitudes like “I could be wrong” or “we just don’t know” type statements"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Also lol. In the top three results on Google for searching the name of the guy that interview is with:"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: In most of his podcasts he is literally thinking through the entire debate / argument out loud and admits that most of what he is laying out is his own personal hypotheses, and that he could ultimately be proven wrong. There's nothing wrong with that in the domain of science. We need people who are challenging the status quo in order to advance our understanding in the long run. I think it is wrong and ultimately counterproductive to censor legitimate scientific conversations no matter how provocative the topic is.\n\nAgain, you don't have to agree with him but I am personally confident that he's doing his best to think through and talk about different topics in an intellectually honest way. It sounds like you haven't listened to him in his long form podcasts and are just forming your opinion based on a made for TV interview in which he is forced to condense his views, thereby excluding nuance that is otherwise contained in the full length podcasts."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah. Like it’s always just another video"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: On the topic of VAERS, how is that reporting system problematic?

{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: And yes, it's clearly difficult to extrapolate the exact number of valid claims and to know causality. It's also hard to say what percentage of reactions go unreported. It could be as high as 10x by some estimates, but even the keepers of the VAERS database admit it necessarily understates any potential issue."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: There was stuff to get political about, if you we so inclined"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: I really don't think the people who were holding off over EUA are going to jump on board once it's formally approved, so if you're expecting this to help at all it would be on account of all the compulsory doses they could give out in exchange for not losing your job"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I don’t think it will change much but I think this idea that it “only has EUA” is dumb"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Literally all of that garbage just means \"bad arthritis\""}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Let me tie my fate to the same thing i should be fleeing, but with extra steps"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: I think the reason USD pegged coins like tether are used so heavily is to avoid capital gains taxes trading in and out of other cryptos."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Not surprising. How does one then avoid taxes by... this"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Thanks schmitty"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: So it looks like it IS a taxable event. But if someone wanted to avoid paying taxes and did it through unregulated means, it would be a lot harder to track down those records than if you traded in and out of USD going through a bank account."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Just easier to commit tax fraud."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I agree it’d probably be hard to catch but I also wouldn’t risk it"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: I think the yield on tether is probably the bigger factor. You get 8-12% on your money."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: That's because you're not rich enough to be successful at it"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: You'd save a lot more than 15-20%."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: How?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: No federal income tax, and oly a 4% fixed \"export services\" tax."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Cost of living while you're there"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: But these are capital gains"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Yes? That's federal income tax"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: You’d save more on short term capital gains"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: Yeah, you are exempt from capital gains too, assuming that you earn them while you live there"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: I've considered geographic arbitrage solely for reduced cost of living"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah. I guess I was working from the mindset of Joe’s example that people with large Bitcoin fortunes are renouncing citizenship to move"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: So obviously that wouldn't work in the sense of avoiding tax on btc that you already have. But it's a pretty sweet deal for a lot of scenarios."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: Traders LOVE Puerto Rico"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: That makes sense and I totally agree that it’s more than 15-20% if you’re high income and short term capital gains."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Also my point wasn’t that cost of living isn’t a factor but you can also move to other locations in the US with low cost of living"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Sure but we were talking about the comparative advantages of Puerto Rico. The tax situation living in Thailand is also different"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I’m not saying it’s bad! But you have to admit the people it’s actually really good for are a very specific set of people."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: It takes someone not tied to a location to make money, and generally a lot of it, and they have to want that lifestyle"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Right"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: For myself, I’d rather just live where I want to live. It seems weird to tie major decisions about your life to trying to save on taxes"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: It’s one thing to minimize them relative to the life you want to leave"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: *lead"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: If you're moving from Cali or another high tax state , you're talking about effectively doubling your income. That's HUGE. Plus, you only need to live there for 50% of the year + 1 day."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: People regularly move to a different state with no ties for a lot less than a 100% pay raise"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: But for that math to hold you have to be an extremely high earner (because you’re talking about your total federal tax rate, not marginal, being at roughly the top tax bracket) living in California who makes their money as income or short term gains in a way that is geography independent"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: It’s just a really small amount of people who that’s even possibly applicable to"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: Sure, for it to work out to double that math is right. But anybody in the middle class who can work remotely would still have a significant increase in their effective incomes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah. I’m not debating that because it’s just math. I’m saying that I think it’s weird to let where you live be dictated by taxes. Obviously others don’t"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: If you’re truly middle class though, it’s not taxes, it’s cost of living"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: The taxes savings are small relative to housing etc."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: I mean he's old but healthy. Carter still alive"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: TIL dementia = healthy"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Jimmy Carter should run in 2024"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: I read this as you were going to refinance to get cash to put on that bet and went \"geez\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Hey fuck you. I tried!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Trump had issues 20 years ago"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I've still got a couple ten thousands left from the last one. Not a bad idea for guaranteed money"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: The difference is, I would be willing to bet every dollar to my name that Biden is currently being treated for dementia with meds. Whereas Trump only has typical signs of cognitive decline due to age."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I uh feel like it would have leaked if that were the case"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: How so? Medical records are private even for the president"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah. I mean a lot of people still have access and it’s more important for the president"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: You've bet on worse, like when you put money on trump winning the election after he lost the election"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: This MF talking about betting odds"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Damn it"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Lol"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: I think I put that bet on at 20/1. No regrets considering how heated the contesting got."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Got damnit! We were good!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: I stand by that dig"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Hey I'll take 2/1 on Biden not making it if someone wants to give it to me"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Consider \"what are the odds of MyPillow Guy getting Trump reinstated in August? \""}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: It was worth betting because of how “hotly contested” the results were"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Even though the contests had exactly a 0% of winning"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Biden sacrificed most of his children in a deal for eternal life"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Damn, that’s cold"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Satan: \"you gotta keep the shitty one\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah, just based on life expectancy it’s a reasonable bet"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: Hey! Hunter has found his true calling as a high end abstract artist!"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: There is in fact concrete evidence that there's no large or medium, or even small scale voter fraud"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Just tiny miniscule scale"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: And in trump's favor"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I didn’t think he said it was unethical but rather that it was a huge risk with large potential to be an ethical issue."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: They broke anti-Trump coverage for it"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Can they do that? What about their charter?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: In CNN's defense, they still took jabs at Trump during that segment about Hunter"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Is this the day that Joe realizes we're not just commies and we also think everyone is full of shit?"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Speak for yourself bro"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: I'm a communist/Democrat party loyalist"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah. I had seen it. He doesn’t say it’s a priori unethical just that it’s fraught with potential ethical issues and so he shouldn’t do it"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Fair enough, comrade"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Idk what the right answer is. It’s a weird situation for sure. The proposed solution of more transparency isn’t clearly better to me"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: It also seems weird to say Hunter Biden can’t sell art because he’s the president’s son"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Why is transparency not clearly better?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Art sales/donations are so ripe for corruption and money laundering though. That could reasonably be in a code of ethics"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Reasonably"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Well it’s not solving the conflict, it’s just making it known but I don’t think the consequences that would actually be suffered would be enough"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I think it’d likely be just a few news cycles"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: *bad news cycles"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: If the purchasing is truly anonymous, then I’d say that’s the same or better than that situation. If it’s not, because the purchaser publicly or privately leaks their name then it still hinges on Joe Biden taking something in exchange for it to be an ethical issue. If that happened, it’d be worse, especially if not disclosed publicly"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Would you say it’s not good if wage growth outpaces inflation?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Just an honest question. I would say then it’s fine."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Well yeah, if wage growth is less than inflation then it’s obviously bad"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Or at least not good"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: My raise this year was 1.51%"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: That is a higher wage"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Good thing you don't spend much of it"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah and it will probably be lower than inflation is this year, unfortunately"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Didn't even cover my first class plane tickets"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I just don’t think it’d be that bad if relatively wealthy people had to face 2-4% inflation for a couple years when low income workers, who haven’t gotten to benefit from massively increased productivity in forever, get some wage growth that outpaces inflation"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Of course that might not be what happens but I guess, to me, some moderate inflation isn’t a priori bad"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: 2% is every year so we wouldn't be talking about that. That's the base case"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Well when it hits housing, it disproportionately benefits the folks who already own everything. The poors lose again!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: We’ve been under 2% for a while so I don’t think that’s an accurate “base case”"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: At least if you choose to believe CPI"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yes, well, there’s an answer for that that we have political trouble with - build a lot more housing"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Way to make the cost of lumber political"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: And a lot was hangover from the housing collapse/financial crisis"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: IMO private central banks are the root cause of all of our economic ills including the record wealth inequality. Their manipulation of interest rate policy necessarily disproportionately benefits the wealthy who can tap into incredibly cheap money using leverage in order to take advantage of the resulting rise in asset prices. The inflection point is shown perfectly on this graph where the end of Bretton Woods (ie the gold standard), effectively unchains the central banks, and perfectly aligns with the decoupling of productivity and hourly compensation."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: I took bretton woods to be the act of establishing the USD as the global reserve currency. I have seen this graph showing the end of the gold standard right around that time. Generally i agree. The system of planned inflation and discounted money to banks disproportionately benefits the already wealthy. It's not to say that there is no way to get ahead, but the system is stacked for the ones who already own everything"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: So when the left criticizes capitalism and blames it for the wealth inequality etc, they should really be protesting the Fed & the bankers."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: It's a natural response to seeing that all their effort isn't enough, not a moral failing"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: That's the thing, I 100% feel for those who are disgusted with what's happening in the world. I just want to point them to the actual problem rather than blaming the greatest wealth creation tool the world has ever seen (ie free markets)."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: You should think about moving to Cuba. I heard they had great socialized medicine there!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Doin something right"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: Exactly! But my guess is you wouldn't want to live there, and the people there are trying to overthrow their socialist oppressive government. Almost like freedom is more important than being given free stuff by the government."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: They're protesting the government cause their economy has gone to shit. And the USA is to blame for that, not socialism"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: You hand picked an example from a generally depressed, authoritarian regime. Taiwan has great Healthcare and a free market economy"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: I too can hand pick an example i like"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: My dig wasn't supposed to be directed at the socialized healthcare, so much as socialism as a whole."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Healthcare can be equitably consumed with the option to pay extra for things outside the standard of care. Lifestyle choices will of course be confounding factors that lead to inequitable consumption of Healthcare"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: It's still a tough issue. Assuming the good in human nature, socialized, non profit medicine is a no brainer. Assuming the real, variable nature of humans, it gets fucking messy."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: The problem is there's so much affecting health besides lifestyle choices, or even genetics. Things like race, poverty, where you live, etc have a real and measurable effect on mortality."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Even if the Healthcare is covered, your employer might not afford you the time to receive care. If you have a shit job and you need every hour you can get to pay your bills but you don't get paid sick leave, you defer care."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: This seems reductive"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: As reductive as \"they're trying to overthrow their socialist government\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Maybe! But the government cut off the internet. Seems like more authoritarianism at play. I’ll take the position that both reductions are bad."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I agree with Carter that Taiwan would have been a better example. Higher life expectancy too"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Happy bday Schmitty 🎈"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Thanks!"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Thanks!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I got my favorite birthday present again this year"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Big booty ho?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: This birthday card from my state rep with a huge photo of himself on it for some reason"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: The level of narcissism is great"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: So the complete opposite of a big booty ho?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: But don’t worry, it’s privately paid for"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I also noticed that none of you have given me any Cummies even though it’s my birthday so I guess you want me to be poor"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: This was clearly a cum rocket"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: And you should be grateful Carter’s loose interpretation of “cum coin” only resulted in some emojis"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Nah be thankful the USPS is backed up"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I’m thankful the USPS is backed up and not thankful that you are"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: I am no longer backed up though! Happy birthday in 3-5 days!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Good for you"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Now you've brought real communists into the mix! You bitch!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: On a completely unrelated note: imagine breaking your leg and some guy rushing to you to hit you in the face after"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: It was a pretty exciting single round of MMA, I must say"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: At least he can't do that stupid fuckin walk any more"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: I used to like McGregor when he could lose somewhat humbly and vow to come back and win. The guy has turned into a complete narcissistic douchebag now though. His post fight interview was disgusting."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: I assume it's good for business"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Also hard to develop an ego when you're the center of attention for so long"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: hard *not* to?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Yeah combat sports are as much about the pre and post match jawing as the actual fight when it comes to selling ppv"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: This seems like a weird conclusion. An embargo that's been in place for nearly 60 years and that contributed to the suffering of the Cuban people for all those years is now finally working as evidenced by Cuban people rising up?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Humble guys get YouTube videos about their technique and character. Arrogant cocksuckers get millions of dollars"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: Would've been nice if it worked sooner. Honestly, I think economic warfare is turning into the best tool to remove evil regimes in general. It'd be nice if the entire world would agree to a trade embargo with China in order to topple the CCP."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: I mean there's real people who die as a result of these sanctions"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Uhhh. What evidence is there for that conclusion?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Where have embargoes worked in toppling regimes"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Not Cuba, not Iran, not North Korea"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: It makes the people suffer needlessly and gives the autocrats convenient scapegoats"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: Yeah, and there are real people (100+ million of them) who have died under oppressive socialist / communist regimes in the last ~100 years."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: That's not a counterargument in support of embargoes..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: \"Would've been nice if it worked sooner\" is begging the question. It presuppose that the embargo is the reason for what's happening right now"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: But that's Krishnan's argument. That it's the US's fault."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: And I say good, free the Cuban people. It's long overdue"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Well that has moved the goal posts from the original point"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: You argued the embargo was good and there was causality"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Now you're switching to say the argument was that freeing the Cuban people is good"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: ￼ https://www.etsy.com/market/shit_stirrer_spoon"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: *to say our argument was"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Damn it"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: *your argument was"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: I'm saying that socialism and authoritarianism is evil, and when left unchecked leads to death and destruction at a level unrivaled in history. And that the ends justify the means of toppling such regimes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: Specifically, I think China is an existential threat to the world at this point."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: But \"the ends justify the means\" presupposes that that the means (embargo) were responsible for the ends accomplished (potentially, assuming something actually happens here)"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: Yes, I'm playing along with Krishnan's claim that the US caused this."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Well you expressly made the point that the embargoes worked though and didn't back that up"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I'm curious what Roshan was going to say"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: And Canada never got on board with the embargo because Justin Trudeau is Fidel Castro's biological son"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: I prefer to stir shit that i think is hilarious"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: The article I posted specifically takes the position that the Cuban government is bad and to blame for Cuba's ills but that the embargo exacerbated the issue without providing any clear benefit to either us or the Cubans."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: I honestly haven't read the article yet. I'll read it in a little bit here."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: \"Come back when you've got a 1.5 hour podcast, bitch!\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: The stated purpose of the Cuban Democracy Act of 1992 (ie the trade embargo) is to maintain sanctions on Cuba as long as the Cuban government refuses to move toward \"democratization and greater respect for human rights\". - Wiki"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Well that’s the purpose, fine, but where’s the evidence that it did anything?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Other than cut the Cuban people off from the western world"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Lol. Should I call him intellectually dishonest?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Just until he’s read that article and then once he’s read that one, another one that’s 20x longer"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Where the real nuance is"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: Either it didn't do anything, and the Cuban people are uprising against their authoritarian government on their own, which is good.\n\nOr it did in fact affect their economy in such a way that is leading to the people rising up and overthrowing their government, which is good."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: Meanwhile, Krishnan ostensibly wants to bring Cuban style socialism to the US. Which I'm maintaining is evil."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: But in the first case it arguably prolonged the regime and caused the Cuban people to suffer"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: You’re billing your dichotomy as a win win"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: How so? In what way could exerting economic pressure prolong the regime?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: When did I say that I want Cuban style socialism? I prefer like a Nordic model"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Cubans got it right when it comes to sandwiches tho"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Because it does nothing to weaken the autocratic control and significantly aids in propaganda efforts"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I would argue that doing everything we can to expose repressed people to the benefits of free society will increase their desire to realize that for themselves"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Also the lack of contact with the outside world generally makes controlling people easier"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: And embargoes contribute to that isolation"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: They are literally waving American flags and chanting for freedom. I'm pretty sure they understand the benefits of a free society."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Right. But that sense could have been fostered earlier without the embargo"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: And on the flip side, how did the embargo contribute to that understanding in any way? That’s what you’re arguing, that it did."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Only took 60 years and countless deaths/suffering to accomplish that couple thousand person strong protest"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: The punishments will continue until morale improves"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: I'm not saying is an ideal solution. But sending money to an authoritarian regime seems even more counterproductive."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Not having an embargo isn’t foreign aid…"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: Buying their stuff is sending them money and supporting the regime"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Yeah idk, I'm not like pro Castro here but it seems like what we've done in Cuba, and really what we've done throughout Latin America, with the ostensible goal of stopping the spread of communism, is super fucked"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: It goes both ways. We also send them stuff."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Economic exchange did a lot to finally end the Cold War"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: And on the plus side we get good run. Win win!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Lol"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: What's the alternative then? We've seen how those systems all inevitably end. You can vote socialism in but you can't vote it out."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Well we can not have CIA backed coups for one"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: We can certainly both agree on how nefarious the CIA is."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Nefarious as fuck"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Yeah the CIA really mortgaged our future"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: They’re hiding alien bodies, 70% sure"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: There he is"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: Only 70%?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: I thought for sure you were in the 99% camp by now."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: Maybe not bodies, but definitely craft"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: My favorite CIA ploy was when they gave guys seeing prostitutes a surprise dose of acid just to like, see what would happen"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Operation Midnight Climax"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: That's a good prank tbh. Guys being dudes"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: They should have kept it up. Just dosing people under different circumstances just to see if the reaction would be different"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Ok here’s one for Roshan. Do you think it’s more likely that the CIA (or government as a whole) has an alien body or has made productive two way communication with an alien (whether face to face or remotely)?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Hmm I’d say alien body because there’s a lot more anecdotes about that from former military officials"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Schmitty loves acid"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Makes sense. I wonder if we will easily be able to communicate with them or not if/when it happens openly"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: From my film experience, everyone speaks English"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Actually though…"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: A lot of stories from abductees and encounters claim the aliens are telepathic"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Same thing"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: What is the actual purported scientific explanation for telepathy? I really don’t know"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Like some sort of induced quantum entanglement?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: You’d have to ask the CIA"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Vaccine induced 5g"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Also did anything happen with those Navy alien patents?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I think they were from the Navy"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Yeah, I haven’t heard of any news about them"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: What a weird little blip in the story though"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I hate it when the kids get vaccines, so I think this is good"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I stand in support of communicable diseases"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Was this right before I posted about aliens?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: It was like mid Cuba discussion"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Several minutes before you said the punishments will continue"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: It’s time"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Tragic"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Call in the property Brothers stat"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Good idea"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Apparently Fravor works for NG"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: No kidding"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Someone told me that and I looked him up and can confirm"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: Big if true"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Even cleared to the program I'm on lol"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: Good stuff. Probably doesn't mean much though honestly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: The guy I sit next to at work knows him and his mind was blown when he heard him on Rogan"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: Yeah it has to be the most comprehensive and documented encounter with a UFO ever."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Though the Biden admin clarified that even if they get here and establish a fear of persecution, the people will be resettled in a third country, not the US"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: As a sort of work around of international law"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Yeah i really wonder whether our war on drugs was really a deliberate effort to keep low cost countries in our pocket. If drugs were legal and made here, cartels wouldn't have the kind of power they do, and Mexico would be much more stable and prosperous"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: My pay is weird because it ramps throughout the year and I always wind up owing but it’s obviously not a 3.5x jump"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah. I’m generally pretty against it but I still think there’s a line that it’s reasonable to draw and taking earnestly saying Hitler was right to do the Holocaust to be over the line doesn’t bother me too much."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Likely, but i don't follow that closely. I just don't get covid"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I mean I don’t know what the authors may or may not have said personally but there’s no way they didn’t understand the implications of falsifying data to promote a vaccine alternative and did it anyway"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: 🧐"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: I didn't do a lot of work for like 8 weeks."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: If any of you have been browsing websites about bourbon recently then yes"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: But not through signal directly, nothing but our devices can read the encryption"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I was on Bulleit's website"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Yeah so they can track you and figure out you’re friends with Joe"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: Gtfo, that's nuts. But how would they link me with them?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: Ah gotcha"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: That predictive advertising really is so good today it makes people think they are being spied on."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Well ￼ you're also using Android"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Not sure if you get that option that iOS has"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I was confused about the relevance of this... But now that I get it that's interesting"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: Ah that makes even more sense"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Granted it started dipping mid 2019 by the looks of it"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Even tho I don't think it matters"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I always click on ads for exotic cars for sale so 99% of my targeted ads are for fancy cars I'll most likely never afford"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Lol the small dip in unscented candles though"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: It definitely does matter, Facebook almost sued Apple over it"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: maybe people were just generally displeased with things at the time"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Candles just got shittier during the pandemic"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: I get it now too. Kinda interesting"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I’ll use it to confirm my priors that the lab leak is real. Late 2019 drop off in scented candle ratings proves that Covid was more prevalent earlier than we knew"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Ergo lab leak"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah. A lot of people were really pissed Apple made that changed. Other smaller apps were also concerned it would seriously limit their ability to make money from ads to the point that they could have trouble remaining a free app / being profitable at all"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: It’s still surprising to me how much genuine effort Apple puts into supporting users’ privacy"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Also, ironically based on Joe’s ad experience, Twitter also puts a lot of legal effort into maintaining user anonymity. They spend a lot of money hiring *really* good lawyers to fight government subpoenas for user data."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: My pandora still thinks i live in Pittsburgh"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Shout out to the 9% that think the vaccine is a microchip but got it anyway"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I’m one of the 9%"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Also, I like how well the microchip thing captures humans’ inability to easily appreciate really small or large numbers/quantities"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: They see the prefix “micro” and assume we can easily make complex circuits that would fit through the needle that used to administer the vaccine"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: *that’s. They’re not tremendously far off, but practically speaking at least an order of magnitude."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Woah that Israeli hacking company I told you guys about is back in the news: https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/18/revealed-leak-uncovers-global-abuse-of-cyber-surveillance-weapon-nso-group-pegasus"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Looks like they’ve been busy beavers"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: But they said it’s only intended for use against criminals, so I don’t understand how this could happen"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: 43% of us adults think vaccines cause autism/aren't convinced otherwise"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: This is why not everyone should be allowed to vote"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I hope it’s actually included in the software license"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: And then the Israeli company goes after them for breach of contract"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Would be an incredibly funny lawsuit"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: What precludes anyone on the list from being a criminal?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Well that would certainly be an argument that they weren’t in violation of the license"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: (I sincerely doubt any license says anything like “you can only use this to track criminals,” but you never know."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Apparently it’s also anecdotally been a trend for restaurant reviews too"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: More people noticing reviews this last year that say things like “the food was incredibly bland. 1/5 stars”"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Does the delta variant also have horrible customer service like its namesake?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Haha. I’ve never had a problem flying Delta"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: They did just weirdly rebook my Raleigh Durham flight direct to O’Hare to have a layover in Detroit but it got in at the same time as the originally scheduled flight so 🤷🏽‍♂️"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Spirit is probably the worst I have flown on. If they miss their runway time, they go to the back of the line. It's like 40 minutes added wait time in the plane"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: But if you ever need anything from Delta. Any changes. I recall that being a bad time."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Spirit is the hottest garbage."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Ironic for a company named after the symbol for difference/change"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: My general take is that amongst the major airlines, they’re all basically the same, and people’s preferences are arbitrary or driven by specific unlucky personal experiences. Very frequent travelers like to seem like they’re really in the know about the best one but it’s mostly just gatekeeping."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Budget airlines being a different story"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: (Not that it’s wrong to have a personal preference, I just don’t put too much weight in it.)"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Yeah they don’t control the airports and they all buy the same planes from Boeing, there isn’t a lot they can do to differentiate. Spirit and Delta unbundle the price of a seat with the price of luggage storage and other in-flight benefits so that’s how they make the tickets cheaper"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: There was a planet money episode a while back about an airline that made more money selling oil futures than through flying planes"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: I think everyone's preference probs has most to do with whatever flies more from their home airport. I prefer United cause I mostly fly from O'Hare. I'd probably prefer Delta if I was in Atlanta or something"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Delta doesn't do the unbundling but yeah, I think that's right. There's some minor variation in customer service etc. but at some point they're tied by available tickets, takeoff slots, etc."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Virgin differentiates by hiring hot stewardesses"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah. I was flying AA to Philadelphia and fly United to Chicago and Delta to Minneapolis."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: This is the kind of thinking that made Branson a billion"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: The best airline tho is Qatar"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: That oil money does it right"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: The A-rabs do know how to run an airline"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I do like how it's kind of like the airlines are just like marketing for them"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Iceland used to subsidize WOW airline flights to Iceland so they could boost tourism."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Once they stopped, WOW folded"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Yeah in a blaze of glory too. They shut down literally in the middle of their flights, people got stranded"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah. That saga was fucked. Literally left flight attendants overseas and weren't going to pay for them to get home"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Wow didn't really have much to offer beyond that Iceland deal tho"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Substantially shittier than easyjet"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Southwest prioritizes customer service, so you don't get change fees. Your money is good for a year and you just update at current prices"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah. Southwest going all in on its model is interesting"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Yeah I like Southwest. They fly out of Burbank which is right next to me"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: For business, I'll fly delta, AA, or United. I'm not paying the fees if someone fucks up"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: They also play nice with each other over delays. They'll rebook you between those three no problem"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: SW is not in that cartel"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: The treating the plane like a greyhound bus when making a connection is a little weird"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: I honestly never fly Southwest, Midway is just kinda inconvenient for me"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: A lot of major airlines focus on loyalty programs and perks, which I think is sort of a way of confusing people with math so they can’t really decide what the best option is"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: “Earning miles” is probably the only innovation airlines have had since the 70s. Maybe in-flight WiFi counts"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Airplanes were actually somehow better in the 70s. People could stand up and walk around, it was more like a lounge than a prison bus"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: And airports are so much of a worse experience too post-9/11"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Prelude to an orgy tbh"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: The 70s, man!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: postlude/prelude"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I know they were a lot more expensive but does anyone know the actual inflation adjusted price difference"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Quaalude"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: https://www.bts.gov/content/annual-us-domestic-average-itinerary-fare-current-and-constant-dollars"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Looks like it’s down from $500 to $300 (inflation adjusted)"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah. That's pretty good, only going back to 1995."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Going back a little bit further"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: That's less than I would have guessed"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: That chart ends right before the 2010s oil price spike though"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Thanks Obama"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Lol. Yeah. I just meant, going back to 1979. I had this impression that in the 70's airfares were still like 1-2k inflation adjusted"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Unless they buy from Airbus"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Got to smoke too"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Southwest has the best model for casual travelers going shorter routes. Business travel is a different ball game"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: But there's a reason SWA is the only airline that hasn't gone bankrupt or been unprofitable (unsure if COVID bucked the profitability situation)"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Best model for the company at least. The refundability is nice for consumers. But, most times I've looked the itineraries are suboptimal relative to others, assuming you're willing to pay a small price premium."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Definitely true cross-country or not their main routes. Hence why I flew JetBlue to/from Boston. I always fly United for work because they're the only non-stop from San Diego to DC"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: (The post front page is older fwiw)"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: From end of April 2021"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah. Maybe the leak of the vaccine passport changed some attitudes about public statements"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Because the stonks are going down. Money talks."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: What was this? I must have missed it"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: The same thing you just shared"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: The odds of failure are the same every time"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: How so? If it functioned correctly the first time, that seems to suggest the likelihood of failure is less the second time. There were unknowns the first time that are know known, changing the probability."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: Yeah, but it was particularly strange."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: \"Storage Cabinets\" for $13k each that happen to have unique individual names"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: I honestly can't blame people for jumping on that one. Especially when they started matching missing teens with the names of the storage cabinets."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: Ironically the biggest reason why I don't buy into it is I feel like the going rate of a human being has to be way more than $13k 🤣"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Also would be the dumbest thing to name anything after the real person you are selling"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Exactly"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: I'm reminded of our fateful river trip with the inflatable boats from aldi hahaha"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: It's survey data, so don't take it too seriously, but there's interesting results here about gender discrepancies in vaccine hesitancy of parents for their children"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: Not surprising."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: As a non-parent, I was a bit surprised. As a parent, why is it not surprising to you?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Dudes rock"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Not a parent. Doesn’t count"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: Women in general are more vaccine hesitant"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: Also, Covid has virtually no affect on young children. The risk/reward profile is ridiculously skewed given that we don't have any long term data on the affects of the mRNA vaccines."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Well that might explain hesitancy generally"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: But there would have to be further reason for the gender difference. I didn’t know women are more vaccine hesitant generally"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Risk to the individual currently, but the longer the virus moves around in children, the more it gets to mutate into something new"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-is-there-such-a-gender-gap-in-covid-19-vaccination-rates/"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: The case for vaccinating children is about removing available hosts and stamping out the disease"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: Just reading the article. It actually states the opposite. That men are less vaccinated"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Dudes no longer rock"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Very similar to giving children the flu vaccine."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: In a globalized world, it's not going to be 100% effective"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: 🤔🤔🤔"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: On a longer time horizon, though, more non-mrna options will be available in quantity"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Is there analyzed evidence yet about transmissibility of delta in children? Some of the calculus Joe referenced seems to depend on early experience that children were more unlikely to be infected with the original strain than adults"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Lmao"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Calvin's not wrong"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: That quote is great"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: It wasn't that they weren't infected by covid, rather they were mostly asymptomatic and if they showed symptoms, they tended to be very mild cold like symptoms."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I mean people who support/supported minimal or no interventions were definitely arguing that “kids don’t get Covid” in addition to that it was mild"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Mom's are way more protective of their kids by a LONG short"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Shot*"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah. I would think that would result in decreased hesitancy though"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Mild symptoms would still result in children continuing to spread and potentially mutate the virus"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Like being overly paranoid about the effects of Covid"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Yeah and recently that turned from getting vaccinated to not getting vaccinated for anything"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Except to Joe's point, COVID doesn't affect kids"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Fuck even most 20 year olds that test positive were like \"I guess I had a runny nose\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Covid does affect kids"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Rarely do they get very sick"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: But they do"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Kids are always sick so it's probably viewed as no change"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: In January our ICU was full"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Right and if delta is more transmissible amongst kids, they may still be at pretty low risk but the absolute numbers are going to be much bigger"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Which is why I was asking if anyone had analyzed the data about that"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: May be hard to tell since prevalence has been really low until recently"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Haven't seen any amongst delta in children yet."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Well it's the testing that results in all those positive cases"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I actually wanted to ask about this, why aren't the vaccines currently approved for children?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: They weren’t in the trials"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: But are in a current one"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Also not wrong"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Current thought is by late summer early fall will be approved under 12"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: So estimates are this fall Pfizer will likely be approved for 2+"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Whore logic"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: But probably not under 2"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Lol"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Ok cool. What's the autism rate though?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Fool me once, can’t get fooled again"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: 💯"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: No evidence specifically like that but I saw somewhere that roughly 20% of new cases over the last month were kids"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Up 20%. Great work!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Shit. Should have used reply. Meant to say autism was up 20% with the new vaccine"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Damn. Yeah. That’s a little scary. More kids start dying and I think it’ll really change attitudes"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Even if they can successfully message that *adults* should get the vaccine to help kids. It becomes an easier choice"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: In fairness, it's likely cause a larger proportion of other age groups are vaxxed"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Absolutely. That's why nobody gave a fuck in the beginning. People care when kids die"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: How many kids have died? We're talking like they rarely ever get severe symptoms"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Oh definitely but still. It’s perception"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Significantly less % than old fat people"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: That was in reply to Krishnan"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: They’re the worst though"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: And people are revenge- socializing"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Generally, not just for Covid"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Fucking hermits out there making friends for the first time"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: My company has been turning \"getting back to work\" into a party."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: I hate it"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I feel bad for kids that aren't in daycare or some form of socialising because the last year would definitely have a huge negative effect in that regard"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: No cool toilet seats anywhere"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Lucy is in daycare and all she had done is brought home colds constantly"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Yeah now that I have a bidet at home pooping at work isn't the same"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Data from AAP"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: What about self reported deaths in VAERS"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: In the last two weeks i went from a private 500 square foot throne room to a warm seat and shoes under every barrier"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: That’s only like 1500 kids"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Not enough dead kids"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: And roughly 1-2% of pediatric cases result in hospitalization. Worth noting that there are other bad outcomes besides death and we have equally little data on long term effects of having covid in kids"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: That’s a lot of other peoples’ poop particles floating around you"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah. That’s a weird part of that point of debate to me. The presumption that the vaccine is somewhat likely to likely to have negative long term effects but that Covid isn’t."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah, the school/daycare thing was pretty botched from the beginning, or at least not handled in an unbiased way. At least the CDC isn't showing signs of drastically revising its guidance in light of the increase in prevalence of delta."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: I had a fever 6 months post vaccine. Should I put that in VAERS?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Count it!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Look. We're just asking questions. Who's to say they aren't related?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: I had a headache, fatigue and mild nausea on Sunday. Probably the vaccine and not the several cocktails I had."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Best way to handle it would be to make the vax mandatory for attending school once it's approved, same way we do with all those other vaccines"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Time to report weak erections and premature ejaculation..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: that was pure Joe bait"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah. I also meant that the developmental issues from the school shutdowns were significantly and, I don’t think, appropriately weighed against the risks of Covid to children."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Has Joe ever baited you?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: I wish"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: No honestly, he might be. Like when he posts something egregiously dumb, maybe he's just triggering me"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah. I've thought that's possible"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Some of it seems... intentional"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: I was being a little more generous with the use of the term \"baited\". You know... \"bated"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: He tried to 'bate me one time at Krishnan and Roshan's apartment"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: That was the origin of the Sloppy Joe nickname. Fun night"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: I'm pretty sure I was there as well"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Somehow"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: We all know what you meant. Same thing you always mean"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: How recently did he make fun of the Holocaust?"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah. And weren’t employee like sub 100 or whatever"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: It’s an interesting dynamic. Tim Cook and Sundar Pichai are paid terribly relative to the shareholder value they’ve created"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: But they’re objectively paid extremely well"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: I haven't heard that. Mask mandate coming back tho"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Judging by the headlines, Chicago's murder rate works exactly like the economy. If artificially suppressed, it has pent up murder demand"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: We did it Joe!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Trump say China virus fake news"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I actually don’t think it’s necessarily inconsistent but he’s never said anything like the vaccines are “objectively good” before"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: The focus on breakthrough infections is so dumb, at least for now. The real issue is vaccine hesitancy and a focus on breakthrough infections on the media probably worsens that"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah. Just terrible messaging from CDC on that point and major news outlets also driving the stupidity. Gotta make up for those missed Trump clicks somehow"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: I'm still wearing masks mostly in public places with the new variant. I know my chances of getting catching it are very low and even lower for getting sick. But a good chunk of my patients cannot be vaccinated and are not healthy. Also if I catch it I can't work."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Levels are low enough that I only really wear it in crowded places like the Sox game I'm going to tonight. All of my patients are immumosuppressed"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Yeah mainly grocery stores and crowded places."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Also I don't sit in doors at restaurants"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Broke bitch"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I’m a big advocate for buying used luxury. 2-3 years old knocks 15-20k off sticker and the car is still in really good shape and much nicer than other new cars for that price"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Yeah plan was for pre owned. Haven't looked too hard in the used electric market yet."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah. Idk about that in particular. I wanted to go for electric in the car we just got Sara but I think they’ll be much better in 3-4 years so opted to wait"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Also thinking about leasing. Owning a care is such a depreciable assett."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Used cars right now make no sense. I'm pretty sure people are selling their Teslas for more than they bought for"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah but you’re also sort of paying for that in a lease. You have to do the actual math for the cats you’re looking at to see"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: My friend has a Ford van that he converted and lives out of now"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: He made a fake surveyor business decal and got the “how’s my driving,” “speed monitored by GPS,” etc. stickers so people wouldn’t bother him"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Every once in a while someone will ask him if he could survey something for them but it’s usually in a neighborhood"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: So he just tells them he only does commercial surveying and then they leave it alone"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: \"You really have to call the main office\" \n*Google voice voicemail answers*"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: The part about automobiles! Figures you hadn't read it!"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: This isn't forced vaccination though"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: Why isn't natural immunity part of the discussion of mandating vaccinations? I'm pretty sure somebody who is 21 years old, healthy, and has already had covid is in a pretty good spot immunity wise"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: If that policy went nationwide that is essentially forced vaccination. If you cannot go to any stores, restaurants, or public establishments and are essentially ostracized from society that is just as bad as forcing it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Maybe. But for now, even in NY, it's indoor restaurant dining and gyms. That's a big inconvenience for a large number of people but it's not like they're being shunned from society"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: One domino starts the chain. Or do they only teach you “one domino may or may not reasonably start the chain” in law school"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Employers are already stepping up to require vaccinations. Walmart, Facebook, Google, Tyson, Disney, etc."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: \"If you don't know, now you know\" \n- vaccine\n- natural immunity\n- notorious BIG"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: It's still unclear why exactly, but  basically the vaccine is a bolus of mRNA for one specific protein and generates a super robust immune response to that one protein. For whatever reason, it lasts longer"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: Read the whole thing"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Oy vey"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: I think Joe reads a lot of 4chan"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: I searched that link and it shows up in their biggest politics forum 8 days ago"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: The real benefit of the vaccine is the reduction in severity"}

Not to mention that I'm referring to young healthy people who don't regularly get severely ill from covid anyway and saying the risk profile of forgoing the vaccine seems reasonable"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Question I'm nearly pissed off enough to ask \"hey what's your BMI these days?\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Then fuck you"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: Same with children. Until we have long-term data on these experimental gene therapy drugs, I don't think it makes sense too vaccinate them since they are broadly unaffected."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: The vaccines aren't gene therapies"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: For the record, and a 100% advocate of people who are older and in high risk groups to get vaccinated. I just think you can have a nuanced discussion about individuals and recognize they have different risk profiles. Just saying \"you have vaccinated you unclean vermin\" is fucked up."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I'm on day 4 of the Chipotle diet, mine is going up faster than Epstein's dick around a 16 year old"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I thought the same thing. CRSPR not out there with the vaccine... Yet!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: There's older, non-CRISPR gene therapies too but that's not what the vaccines are"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: \"Currently, mRNA is considered a gene therapy product by the FDA. Unlike certain gene therapies that irreversibly alter cell DNA and may cause certain side effects, mRNA-based medicines are designed not to irreversibly change cell DNA. \""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: From the form 20-F"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: Great. It's still aging therapy drug though."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: It's a \"gene therapy\" because the FDA doesn't have a separate classification for these types of vaccines because they're new"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: It does not permanently alter your cells, which is the classic definition of gene therapy"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: just take the L bro"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: No."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Has Joe ever taken the L bro"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Your arguments are supported by a selective reading of the words that contradicts the rest of the context they're written in."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: \"Even though our mRNA product candidates are designed to have a different mechanism of action from gene therapies, the association of our product candidates with gene therapies could result in increased regulatory burdens, impair the reputation of our product candidates, or negatively impact our platform or our business.\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Also from the 20-F"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: \"Gene therapy products have the effect of introducing new DNA and potentially irreversibly changing the DNA in a cell. In contrast, mRNA is highly unlikely to localize to the nucleus, integrate into cell DNA, or otherwise make any permanent changes to cell DNA. \""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: \"highly unlikely\" 🤣"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Of course not"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Yeah it just localizes to the ovaries"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: Regardless of the term you want to use, they are 100% new tech in humans and very much experimental. Nobody can tell you in good faith that they are 100% safe in the long term. It's just impossible to know at this point."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Experimental in what sense?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: That they've been given ~1 billion people?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: They're literally still under \"emergency use authorization\""}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: We know getting covid is 100% safe in the long term tho"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: To respond to some stuff non-sarcastically:"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: The estimated protection against repeat infection was 80% in all comers, 47.5% in the elderly"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Which is worse than vaccines and certainly worse than past infection+vaccine"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Taking more about natural immunity vs. vaccines now"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Actively supporting vaccination for whatever groups he deems to be \"high risk\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: That still isn't going to provide us long-term safely data. So yes I think it's still reasonable to be precautionary in the case of the young and healthy"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Precautionary like getting a vaccine instead of getting covid?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: But you'll at least have to stop making this specific point"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Not high-BMI recovering alcoholics who used to love taking street drugs"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: No, like not getting a vaccine that we don't have long-term safety data on which is killed all of like 300 children in the US."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Lol. It's a carve out"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: That's a staggeringly low number"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Oh, the dumb sort of precautionary"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: I was happy when my buddy who does loads of blow to the vaccine. At least i never had to call him out for drawing arbitrary lines around what unknown drugs he'll put in his body"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: What do you think are the possible long term effects? Or is it just the general unknown? And what's your time horizon to know it's safe?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Where does he find these websites?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Cnsnews?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: They're all like big with right wingers"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: 1) overall deaths is not a bad argument\n2) children also have long term affects from covid\n3) children are a huge reservoir for Covid so vaccinating them will help to decrease spread and mortality in adults. We saw the same thing when children get their flu vaccine."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Colorado herald?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Like Roshan said, probably 4chan or conservative subreddits"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: What about their ovaries tho"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah. It seems more likely that there would be unknown long term effects from a novel virus than from a vaccine for that virus."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: I’ve got… Gulf of Tonkin, MKUltra, Midnight Climax, and the Stargate Project. Maybe also the thing where they sold guns to narcos, not sure if they fessed up to that"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Osama bin laden raid"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Or is that just common knowledge they didn't have to admit to"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: That’s not something they hid though because it’s good for their brand"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: The ones I listed are like acid and telepathy experiments, or funding coups, terrorists and drug dealers"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: They had reporters in the NYT, WaPo, Time"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I’d also be pretty curious to see how it broke down for STEM vs humanities PhDs"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: Also, doesn't operation mockingbird make you a little suspicious about everything the mainstream puts out? In my opinion almost everything in the mainstream media is full of distortions, lies, and half truths in order to create their narratives.

{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Distort it relative to what though?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Sure but your impression of the “distortion” is based on your own biases (as is everyone’s)"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Yeah I think these alternative media sites often have just as much if not more of a bias and distortions than mainstream media"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: Yeah but at least most of the alternative media sites are openly either conservative or liberal. And there's nothing wrong with giving the news with a conservative/liberal bent if you are open about it. It's when institutions claiming to be unbiased \"journalist\" inject left wing talking points into the stories while still insisting on being neutral."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: To the author's original point, plenty just find an alternate market, it's not erasing our history, and it's largely just a talking point for the right wingers trying to divide us"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Kevin hart bounced back before i could even find out he was engulfed in controversy"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: I think it's real to some extent and there's obviously egregious examples of comedians losing appearances for offensive jokes, but more often than not it's a crutch and gets leveraged into new appearances etc"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Yeah mostly just what Carter said"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: You know... because i don't watch colored news"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: I dare you to tweet that"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Don't have twitter"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Fired 4 truth"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah. They’re both enjoyable."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Remember that creepy as fuck video he did himself but as the House of Cards character to try to come back but it was too early?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yes"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Schmitty has weighed in"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Anyway go back 10 years and try to imagine which celebrity opinions you knew publicly and in real time, as they learned new information either before or after you did. Their brands didn't require it, so only a few were really vocal. Contrast that to today where Elon Musk manipulates the price of a currency that didn't exist via a tweet"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Happy birthday!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Like how you get cancelled off of YouTube and then wind up with a 10k+ per month Patreon on the back of being cancelled."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: A) stat news is stupid B) antibody tests are extremely unreliable markers of prior infection"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Good to know"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: What about the people who did test positive and had those symptoms?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: What is used as the standard of prior infection though if not antibody tests?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: There is no \"standard of prior infection\" other than you had a positive pcr at some point"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: That's how we know it's a hoax"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Are you seeing any people who have, or appear to have, long term non-respiratory symptoms?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: My cousin got COVID toes"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: And some other rash I think"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Sounds like GP stuff, not ICU stuff"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Somewhat but they're not seeing me for those non resp symptoms. I saw one lady in clinic for a lung transplant eval who had a really bad case of covid resp failure, she was still complaining of mild memory issues and stuff like that"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: And she was a practicing gyne surgeon prior, so obviously very functional"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah. I just wonder where it will all shake out if/when there is good evidence. It does seem like there's some percentage of long term issues but it also seems like some of the \"I still get a lot of headaches and/or brain fog\" may be more psychosomatic or other underlying mental illness, like depression or anxiety"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Isn't this the anti-alien guy anyway? Clearly anything he says is discredited by not loving aliens"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Unlike katy perry, who loves aliens... and black penis"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: For those who got real sick, cognitive issues following ICU stays are fairly common and well documented, but it'll be interesting to see if there is a signal beyond that. For those who had mild COVID, I think there is still a lot of data to come from long term follow-up studies"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Aren't corticosteroids known for changing people for life?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Not for life, at all"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah that was something I hadn't realized. Sara's mom spent a couple months in the ICU at the end of last year and it took a while (like 2-3 months) for her to come back to who she was before"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Steroid psychosis for sure happens, but rather rarely and is duration limited"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: It was surprising to me that it can take so long"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I should say *fully come back. Most of it happened over a couple weeks."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: But she was intubated (twice) for a cumulative time of almost three months"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: What was different? Was she really slow or just extra mother-in-law-y?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Lol. Yeah. Mostly slower and more absent minded etc. Not like a different personality"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Yeah post ICU syndrome is a legit thing and more common than people think"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Also, I actually get along great with Sara's parents but they're pretty hands off. When she calls them they talk for like 5 minutes and then try to get off the phone. I also spent a lot of time with them, with Sara, when I lived in Pittsburgh."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Noooooo"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Glad the author cleared that part up"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: It's just so rich to pin your vaccine hesitancy on a movie at all, let alone one like I Am Legend"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: How about the show utopia?"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: We are about at July 2020 levela"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: California in general slightly higher than last summer. Not nearly as bad as the winter"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: But deaths are down"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Third time's the charm"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: So is the vaccine not that effective against the variant(s) or are there that many unvaccinated?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Delta is significantly more contagious"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: So people are getting faster. Those hospitalized are overwhelming not vaccinated"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: It's somewhat less effective against Delta which is much more contagious, albeit still effective, but there are that many unvaxxed"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Luckily deaths are staying somewhat low but are on the rise."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: So far hospitalizations in the new wave far outpace deaths"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: But we shall see if it is just a catch up game"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I responded"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Why everyone going to Italy"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Italy rules"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Oh shit"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Caveat that my sister is fairly dramatic though"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Why does your sister know Joe's dad"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Lmao at that relationship, not at the covid"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Joe helped my sister and dad do something with our old house, I don’t know how she knows Joe’s dad or why they keep in touch though"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: I'm gonna have trouble putting that aside, but shit man hope he's doing alright"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Joe or Joe's dad has covid?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Joe’s dad"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: I was confused by that too tbh"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: I’ll ask for clarification"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: I wonder if his dad is vaxxed"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: ~70 y/o and hasn't exercised since he was single, if i had to guess. No other health issues like diabeetus that I'm aware of"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Just filling in the health profile"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Yeah he is the exact phenotype of dude who does bad with covid"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: But what about his genotype?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Doubtful. I know Dan was also pretty lax about everything. Just moved the wedding back 2 weeks when his fiancé got covid"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Proudly unmodified"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah. It really sucks that it’s so easy to make it much less of an issue but people aren’t willing to take that step"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Maybe that was part of the reason Joe’s vaccine tone was different last week? Like saying high risk people should get it etc."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: I'm still a little shook at Roshan's sister just casually texting with Joe's dad"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: That was a newly introduced nugget of mainstream consensus, but it fit within the bounds he had set the entire time... which is whatever Joe Rogan said"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Maybe he has been getting more exercise than i thought"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: 🤣"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Fair enough but he had still never said anything like that before last week"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Probably should have expected that one"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Don't fuck up our window here Carter, this is our one source of JOEVID info"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: There's still fucking zero self-awareness. Between not realizing he's a fucking sow and believing he's somehow impervious to media bias because he exclusively digests the most biased media. That's what strains me the most"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: I sincerely apologize for any implications one might have inferred from my thoughtless statement, Roshan."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Let’s be cynical and just assume they’re trying to pump dvd sales"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Probably slow going cause who buys DVDs still"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Yeah but it's being pirated at record rates"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Damn man. Hope hes ok"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah for real"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: ￼ did you ever find out if you got it?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: I wonder what happened. It looks like he was last texting in the other chat on like Thursday, around when I started feeling shitty too"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: It spreads like a computer virus now?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Guess Joe had McAfee"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=47Fbo4kU2AU"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: It can happen"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Is he like hospital sick? Or just a rough case"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Let's just add Roshan's sister to the group chat"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: And Joe's dad. Make it a big party."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: I'm assuming passed out on the couch wishing he closed his options positions while he still had the energy"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Like Chris Cuomo's case. Drained but not hospitalized"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: I thought Andrew was the one who was tryna get drained"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Speaking of which"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: https://t.co/IGgA8UqtoY"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Anybody got a way to get in contact with Joe"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Apart from him being on signal?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Well anybody try to text him"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: I can ask him since I have a good reason to know he has covid"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Plus I think he likes me better than most of you"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Joe and i were close until he turned into a staunch right-wing asshole"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: It’s the Joe Rogan bond."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: jk"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: But not really"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Is there a term for Joe Rogan fans?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Joe Hoe-gans"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Yeah I'd text him but..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Max is for sure his favorite and probably Jonas too, but neither of them are supposed to know he has covid"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Yeah that might push him over the edge. Blood pressure spike might finish him off"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Lol Carter I respect your energy here but c'mon man"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Agreed but also, seems that being a doctor has made Krishnan soft"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: I'm not itching for a bad outcome. I'm just fucking disappointed that it's even a reality. This was preventable."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah. I don't mean this in a mean way but I sincerely wonder if Joe was on ivermectin when he got infected."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: I considered that the affects he is seeing are just side effects of ivermectin or drug interactions from it mixed with hydroxychloroquine or ram's piss and healing crystals. I dunno. What else is Tucker hucking these days?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: This is unfortunate"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: It's hard for someone to fall in my opinion as hard as Pierre Kory did"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: In English?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: I went to a few lectures on ultrasound by him a few years ago and they were legit really good, and he's a really nice dude and good teacher in person"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Basically he's acknowledging that the main ivermectin protocol they were pushing isn't working but saying you really should just do the other ivermectin protocol he came up with instead"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Instead of just getting vaccinated"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: (I had to look up what MATH+ and I-MASK+ were)"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: This is i-mask"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Absolutely nonsense. Nasopharyngeal essential oils is hilarious"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah. I love that both of them are like 12 things in a very specific administration procedure"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Like literal 12D chess against Covid"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: MATH+ is the same metabolic resuscitation shit that Paul marik has tried to push for years and has been completely disproven in other diseases"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Also like LMAO that this is for people administered to the hospital and he's \"recommend[ing]\" that you use a pulse oximeter"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: No i-mask is for outpatients"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Ohh. Ok. Sorry. I had only looked closely at the math one"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: And assumed they were both for hospitalized patients"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: *assumed incorrectly"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: What do you think drives someone like him to go so far down this road? Is it honest belief or just ego, desire for fame, etc.? It just seems so weird to me in a field like medicine"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: I think it's likely ego and dame. Went from being regionally known in a niche community to testifying in front of Congress. At this point he's too entrenched to admit it"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah. What a shame. I guess he's got a second chance at more fame when he learns the error of his ways and then does that whole dance"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: It’s always some dame, isn’t it?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: He told some hot chick he had a secret cure to COVID and now he can’t back down"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Bitches love ivermectin"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: *tosses cigarette butt out window of convertible*"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Human ivermectin"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: *bitches* love dog ivermectin"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Good point"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Another reason why we're inevitably fucked as a society"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: My hospital is out of inpatient beds."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Not not necessarily from covid but we full"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Always close your options! Always!!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Or just get vaccinated and trade whenever"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I couldn't close mine today because I have to leave my phone in my car. I'm on travel to a customer building and can't get back in when I leave"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I'm also now drinking at the embassy suites bar waiting out a thunderstorm to walk next door to get chick fil a"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Sounds like a fun day"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I got an idea! Krishnan lures Joe out by admitting he has COVID but saying it's minor but is doubting the vaccine now telling Joe he might have been right"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: All while knowing Joe was wrong"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Touche"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I got served a whiskey coke in a pint glass"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: And haven't eaten"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: That's either too much whiskey or way too much coke"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Or a bargain"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Drink coupons. Before COVID it was a 2 slosh fest."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Now you get 2 coupons per night of your stay"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Homewood suites in San Antonio just left a keg out on weeknights... like weeknights would slow me down"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Yeah same this only applies during weeknights. It's like \"oh you're on work travel? Let's turn you into an alcoholic since you've got nothing else to do\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Oh yeah. They did that to you"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: LOL THE MAYOR OF DC IS BOWSER"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Pretty sure it's that every time you bust a nut you have to feed it"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Biden isn't real we are straight up living in Mario"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Go exercise so you don’t get Covid"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Or can fight off Covid, whatever"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Shut the fuck up schmitty"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: I'm sure Corona is one of the available options"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I actually was thinking of going for a run then thunderstorm happened"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I will never"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Also, I changed seats with someone to let him sit next to his wife/GF/whatever, giving him my window seat and taking his middle 2 rows back"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: And then this fuck goes and keeps not wearing his mask"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Damn. He played you"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: For the liberal cuck that you are"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: How did you think that was going to change things?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: He sure fucking did. But I got free beers and a clear conscience"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: And you can't take away feeling good. I almost believe in God again"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Did you get another whiskey coke pint?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I'm almost to the bottom. I think I need to go outside"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Take your shirt off at the bar"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: To get struck by lightning?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: It’ll help keep you from getting too drunk"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Better get another drink to be safe"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Game on"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I'm gonna be majorly fucked up"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Majorly fucked up is a mindset. You're only as fucked up as you let yourself be"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: 🤯"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: I'm just trying to get max tanked enough to text Joe and find out details"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I mean it would be nice to know that he’s like not imminently being intubated"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Seemed like a good joke"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: It was funny"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: I laughed"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Story please"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Maybe that's what finally slightly derailed that train. If anything, he's welcome"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Basically to ask Lisa the prom I sent her on a scavenger hunt across the campus. I stupidly used my friends as the people to give her the envelope clues. At each stop they all asked her to prom for themselves."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: And then later claimed “I thought I was taking Lisa to prom? “"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Lol"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Classic prank"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Max remember when we got lost on a scavenger hunt and just played basketball with Q and someone else (Hemal?) until our girlfriends found us like \"hey wtf?\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: The ending of the story sounds right to me, the beginning part doesn't..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Rather, I don't remember the basketball part mostly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: I know we stopped at the gym and played. I guess we were supposed to find some shit at the concession stand"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I definitely remember being found after taking too long lol"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: I texted him hours ago and haven’t heard back"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: FYI. Feel free to reach out through your secret white golfer channels Max"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I destroyed $15 worth of chick fil a so I'm significantly less drunk"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Are you significantly more homophobic?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I definitely would have had I drank my second drink vs saving it for after eating"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Considering how good it tasted I definitely am less inclined to try dick"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: So yes"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I like this evening plan of one drink, leave the bar and go across the street for chicken, then back to the bar for another drink"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Based on these semi-comprensible texts you may still be drunk"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Yeah you sound like Jonas texting sober"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I got the drink before I left to make sure I had it waiting for me in my room"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Yeah usually i go across the street for after hours beers"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: I'll be honest though I kinda want a drink now"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Bet you won't"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: I'm on call 😔"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: I had a rule in residency that I just had to be more sober than the patient. But now I work in a peds hospital."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Easy in Flint"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Exactly"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Kids are basically like drunks though"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Good thing it’s only 7"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Pussy"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: He removed a bottleneck"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: By adding a bottleneck"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: It really was"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I'm watching ESPN for the first time in many months. Colts going to have to use a shitty rookie because Wentz is still hurt. Glad we dodged that bullet"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: That's interesting that they cut off at 23"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Ah"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: But is that medically driven or bureaucratic?"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: You know there are simpler ways to make a faraday cage, right?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Microwaves are cheap"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: So is like, sheet metal with holes"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: We're landlords. I have tons of spare appliances"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: You don’t want holes, aluminum foil would work"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: That's like the dumbest idea that you have to be smart to pull off"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Or was that a joke I missed"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: A metal bucket is a faraday cage. You can have holes but they need to be smaller than the wavelength"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Fair enough"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: I guess the holes might be useful if you only wanted to block a certain range. But a metal bucket is safer for the paranoid"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Is normal aluminum foil really thick enough though?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I agree about the bucket"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Not sure, probably want to add layers to be safe"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Heavy duty aluminum foil*"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Everyone should definitely go wrap their WiFi routers in aluminum foil unless they want Sleepy Joe jerking it to their text messages"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: From wikipedia. Apparently normal Al foil is 0.5 mm thick, about"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: So it should be thick enough, barely"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: I'll stick with heavy to be safe"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Actually, I'm a moron who wasn't looking at it being log-log. It's enough for cell phone signal by a lot"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Or just use my several spare appliances!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: No, you'll stick with a giant microwave instead"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: You don't even need spare microwaves if you can commit to not testing wireless charging on your phone"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I guess the issue with Al foil would just be if you accidentally tore a little hole while wrapping something then it wouldn't work anymore"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Hence the heavy duty"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Rachel HATES Family Guy for some reason, but I showed her the Jesus scene (when Stewie time travels) and she died so there's a chance"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: But overall it's \"too crude\""}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: What’s the fastest growing race in the US?"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: This is white genocide"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: \"It's for science!!\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Come on........"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Also don't think for one second I'm going to forget Biden's dumbass bringing the Taliban back into power"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Mexicans, Taliban, Biden, vaccines"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: But at least he's really concerned about the fake news Chinese virus that I had to get a vaccine for that doesn't exist. Know what does exist? The Taliban"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: We’re hitting all the right notes"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: I've seen videos"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: He hasn't seen it yet to be fair"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Even his lord and savior, Tucker, son of Carl, was featured."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: He must not have received Ivermectin"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I actually think the Taliban thing was sort of inevitable. Very dumb that we spent trillions of dollars and 20 years to delay the inevitable"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I knew you'd be here to have an idiotic liberal take"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Going from pharmacy to pharmacy looking for human ivermectin"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Do you actually think we should have just stayed in Afghanistan or are you shitposting?"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: *stronger"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Or put the safety on for that matter"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Did you hear back at all when you texted him?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I still can't tell whether you're just shitposting"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Not shit posting. You think we should've pulled out?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah. For the reason I gave. I don't think we were ever going to be dominant enough or train the Afghans well enough to prevent the Taliban from taking over when we left"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: And I don't think anyone wanted to stay there literally forever"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: So we should have just left a long time ago, like once we got Bin Laden at the latest"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Yeah fuck it that way we had to go back and fight again in 4 months."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: The real American response would be to pay them off"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Kinda concerning"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I think it makes way more sense to have stayed and kept the Afghani people free from daily terror"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah. But yet he’s been reading the group chat"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Why?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: We spent $800B on the Iraq war, couldn’t we have just given it to the Taliban instead? There’s no rich terrorist"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Hard to guess at what’s really going on"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Was that what we were doing?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: The horse ivermectin is working"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Weren't letting the Taliban win that's for sure"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Our presence there spawned new Taliban on a daily basis"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: They would've spent it on Virgins and wanted more"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Those damn soldiers getting those Taliban women pregante again"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Yeah actually he has read some of the chat since I started this afternoon"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: He just can't read that fast with the brain fog"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: “Preganté” that’s when you’re pregnant with a Mexican baby"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Pretty sure that’s a pasta sauce"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: That's Prego"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Did the release the ivermectin trial?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: No, Rachel's prego. The sauce is Ragu"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: No, Raghu Echempati is a professor at Kettering University. You're thinking of Classico"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Sort of. The data hasn't been released or peer reviewed but it's about to be presented and it's apparently negative for any benefit"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Even for being dumb?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Feels like there’s gotta be a positive benefit of ivermectin for being dumb"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Do you know how many formerly parasite ridden horses you just offended?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: At least dozens"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: https://twitter.com/christinawilkie/status/1425977681850638337?s=21"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: I feel like this kinda shit shouldn't be legal"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah. Agreed."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: For $15k? There’s probably bigger fish to fry"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: You're probably right but the scope is kinda irrelevant to me, it shouldn't be legal for 15k or like pelosi making millions"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah. No reason to have it hinge on a threshold amount."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: It’s also problematic, despite the small amount, that it took over a year for him to make the disclosure"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: It’s supposedly the only individual stock they’ve bought in forever. Not like they just forgot it from some laundry list"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: What would the law be? He bought the shares after Joe bought a bunch of masks, there was already a lot of public knowledge already"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Congresspeople and their spouses should be barred from trading individual stocks altogether while they're in office"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Can they have any type of IRA or retirement account? Or they can’t even indirectly invest?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Keep in mind Peter Thiel has an IRA that investments in his own companies, with no active management on his part of course"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Well, they could give them the option that presidents before Trump used."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: But then banning retirement accounts seems extreme"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Individual stocks. Funds and shit would be fine"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: You can either put everything in a independently controlled trust whose management you don't have substantial contact with and have to disclose any insubstantial contact or you can can control it and can't trade individual stocks"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah. I don't think the type of account has any bearing. It's what the securities are. They can invest in ETFs, mutual funds, and the like"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: I wonder how the really rich ones siphon money from the government though"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Most of these congressman inside trading things are really small amounts of money, like tens or hundreds of thousands at most"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: We spend $2T a year, there’s gotta be some bigger rackets going on"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: you're probably right that there are, but it doesn't mean this isn't something that should be fixed"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Awarding contracts"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: So then to combat corruption in awarding contracts, they'll establish redundant watchdog agencies and protocols, the inefficiencies of which we also pay for"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: In which year did we only spend 2 trillion?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I actually don't know how much of that other stuff happens. A lot of people in Congress who are really rich either were before they came (e.g., Romney) or they're just trading off their name to get access to opportunities"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Not necessarily taking from the government"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Well they can approve something that will have a fairly obvious beneficiary and then find themselves funded for life because of it"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Say i approve a bill allowing emissions exceptions for oil and gas operators on leased land, now i eat nothing but steak and caviar during my whole campaign and end up with a lobbyist gig for huge sums of money after I'm out of office"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Is there a more technical name for a house-shaped pentagon?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Like that's used in mathematics"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Home plate"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Thanks. Very helpful"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Very interesting"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Lol the official standard home plate dimensions are physically impossible"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: I like this fun fact"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Every baseball game is invalid"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: In addition to being kind of boring"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Two negative tests. No Rona for me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Surbhis tested negative four times since I was diagnosed"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Does that prove it's not transmitted through semen?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Or that the vaccine is stronger than his semen."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: The fact that Jonas is negative does"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: I did the saliva test yesterday. Never again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Guess you didn’t plow your mentor that hard"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Never again?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Saliva test sucks. It's so much saliva"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: It's only 3ml but feels like a gallon"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Ah"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: I sat there for 5 min spitting into this tube with the dryest mouth in the world."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: A sight to behold, I’m sure"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: I did saliva last Thursday too. There is nothing that makes your mouth dryer than knowing you have to produce a shit load of spit"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Is it a better test than nasal or is there some other reason you wouldn’t just do that?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Not from what I've seen. It's more comfortable.."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: That's just the test they had at the place I went"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Who knew that semen gave you dry mouth"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: The nasal swabs hurt so bad, I hated them"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: I felt like they were poking my brain"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: they're way more shallow now"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: But the home tests go just as deep if not deeper"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Yeah the last one I did I barely cried"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: That’s interesting. I didn’t know that. I’ve only ever gone to a testing center (though haven’t in a long while) and the current amount of penetration is fine"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Light penetration"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: ￼ you alive?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Also Desantis says that Florida covid patients should all get regeneron"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: What a dunce"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Rand Paul must have filled him in"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: After buying some more stocks"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: That he’ll tell us about next year."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Shooting my shot"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: You know what's better than getting covid and taking regeneron? Not getting covid"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Max are you day drunk again"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: The real irony here is that he’s a libertarian and would have made more money on Bitcoin"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Well, he says he’s a libertarian but he’s pretty much a non-interventionist conservative"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I didn’t get Max’s comment or why it would mean he was day drunk and then I saw the other chat"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Regeneron is a big client so I think I’m legally obligated to say that you should take as much Regeneron as you can"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Hahaha"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: I have 35 clinic notes to write. How many bears do you think I can drink before I'm done"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: How many bears???"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Beers"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: But if I had a bears I'd drink them too"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Jesus"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: THE FUCK"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Cmooon"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: At least that means he's alive. Technically that's an answer"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Or someone has his phone"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: What if Trista is reading his messages"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah. A little weird that he’s just ghosting us"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Possible!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: I know it's dark, but there are no new obituaries for Janiczek. He's either still with us or Trista was too cheap to get an obit"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Back to the point about closing your options..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Sure would be a dirty joke to switch the names of these chats and spam them both..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: C'mon man"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: My day has been full of strife. I'm using darkness to stop me from getting super fucked up in front of the family"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: That’d be fucked"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Can we modify COVID to kill certain people? Like there has to be something wrong in your DNA to want to drive a Civic but make it really loud"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: I thought it was already fine-tuned for Asians"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Max who shit in James's pants?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Oh dude I was very curious about that"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: I swear these pants were pre-shitted"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: ??"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Still dealing with this damn RSV, but i still feel like a genius for hooking the nose frida to a breast pump"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Rachel posted a Instagram story about how James was given pants at daycare that had shit in them"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Dude that's ingenious"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Does it work!?!?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Oh boy. I nearly just peed. I'm holding it and that almost did it"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Does it ever!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Like a shop vac for your child's nostril"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: The best part is that you know it was a pocket shit. Like some kid put a turd in his pocket at one point"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: But it pulses like the shower head my wife likes so much"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Nah I think he had mudbutt and used the pocket to wipe"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Oh God. I'm gonna pee"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: There's a 20% chance that's chewing tobacco. You need to have a serious talk with your son"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Yeah they were loaner pants that weren't cleaned right. Fucking gross"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Also don't jump on Joe for being an idiot. I'm convincing him to respond. It sounds like he has it seriously bad"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Ah dip. Is he in hospital"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Yeah it's one thing to make fun of him when he's being an idiot and completely fine, totally different thing to do it when he's actually sick"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I'll let him tell you"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Disagree. He cooked this goose, now sleep in it"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Nope."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: I've said it before, most of these people aren't bad people, just really misled and don't realize how big of a mistake they're making til it's too late"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: I really have gotten soft in my old age"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Yeah dude"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: It keeps going through my head that Joe is smart enough to be influential - a leader. He chose to be a thought leader in South Eastern Indiana in anti vaxx sentiment"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Maybe it's because he had Thompson for SI..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Doc Sue was where it's at."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Like a good engineer"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah. Kind of impressed the degree to which it happened"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: If you're ever constipated you can probably just shove it up your ass too"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: If this helping to create a friendly environment to return to?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: If you get a kidney stone? Right up the dick hole"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Is that what they teach you in medical school?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: How to suck on various holes?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: That's how they teach them to pay off med school"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Is this professional advice?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: To that point, i sent this to a group chat to my family and the ladies did not get/ ack the joke"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Lmao"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I pulled the previous tenant’s hair out of the garbage disposal at my new apartment today"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Which was not pleasant"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: It had wrapped around one of the rotating cutter pieces"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Very similar plot point in one of the final destination movies"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I avoided that fate"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: I can't put my hand near a garbage disposal or drive near a truck with those huge logs because of that movie."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: How often are you near a truck hauling logs?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Literally never."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: But still."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Colt McCoy still in the league???"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Damn"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: First bears preseason game today, gonna be on NFL Network so everyone can watch the future 🐐"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Nagy said Fields is going to get a lot of playing time"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Confirmed he’s alive"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Or Trista is playing the long con"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Damn man"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: What’s the usual turnaround time for covid pneumonia?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: If you're bad enough to be in the hospital, it can be pretty long. Our usual length of stay was 5 days for covid, but we've had hospitalizations that were several months long"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: its hard for me to say anything without clinical details."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Roshan figured out that the bread is still erect"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah. Shit. That is pretty serious."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Idk if he'd take me up on this, but I'm happy to talk with him more in details or if he has any questions"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: I don't want to up and text him about it unless he said you could tell us"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: The baguette is a very under used boner emoji. Nice work"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Respeck"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah. It’d be cool if you could ask him if you could tell us"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Yeah reveal that we're all horrible friends"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I mean so that we can reach out"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: It’s for when you like it real dry"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Honestly I’m just glad to have friends that could appreciate it. Thanks everyone 🙏"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: We lie to ourselves first, Schmitty"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Alright I just told him I mentioned it to some of you guys because people were wondering why he wasn’t responding"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: And sandy"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: But don’t text him right away otherwise he’ll catch onto the existence of this sidechat"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: The ol sandy cock"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: man I’m so deep in this lie"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: We’ve somehow roped in my sister and Joe’s dad into this web of lies"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: For me I usually have to use this emoji 🔬"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah. Just getting you ready to have that second family eventually"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: https://youtu.be/GH1ruMGpTVY"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Didn't this bitch get cancelled for being in the KKK or something"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: I still can't get over them just texting each other"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Would Joe be my nephew??"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Something like that"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: It was some local STL oligarchs, not the Klan. She'll be fine by next season"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Fuck"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: You know I keep that MF thang on me"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: I’m hungover this is a lot to process"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Yeah them. Anyone on the rich side of delmar, really"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Is that where Heikes learned her bj skills?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: She kind of looks like Ellie Kemper"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: 🤣"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: The very tolerant left"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: I talked to him a bunch. He's legit sick, like was on a pretty substantial amount of oxygen. He seems to be getting better tho"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Finally some common sense policymaking"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: https://twitter.com/nicholasmoreano/status/1426582257171673092?s=21"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Well at least I didn't spill the beans. He told me he didn't want the lecture that's why he hasn't said anything"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: That's the STARTING offensive line???"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: What if we recorded a 2.5 hour podcast ...?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: If nagy gets fields killed I am declaring jihad"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Andy Dalton gonna die again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Dude we had like 5 injuries in a week"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Well they'll kill Dalton first"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: That’s too bad. I definitely wouldn’t have. It already happened. Not much to say at that point."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: No dude fields is gonna be out there with the backups to those jabronies"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: I didn't lecture him, I swear"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Joe we think you're an idiot but we don't want you to die"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Our 2nd round pick can't even practice"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: But to that point he's kind of proving that he was wrong and that's a lot of pride to swallow"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: The dudes who are not as good as them"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: He has that coveted natural immunity now. Not wrong"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: I thought Dalton wasn’t playing"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Rip Bears hopes"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Without any side effects from the vaccine!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Red rifle gets the first series or two"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Yeah I got double immunity now. Immune as fuck bro"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: The a hefty dose of Fields"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Then*"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Can I get some of them antibodies???"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: I was so excited to finally have an elite o line"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Honestly I'm kinda hoping for that"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: tevan \"Gabe Carimi\" \"Chris Williams\" jenkins"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: I wouldn't. Getting covid sucks ass"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: chocolate rain lookin bitch"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Even for Pfizer pfam like me"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Props to pace for remaining true to form and trading up for him. The dude cannot help himself"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Apparently moderna better long term."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Pfizer gets limp dick after awhile"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Ironically"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Only looking at antibody titers tho"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: It's beautiful"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: My working theory is that this is never going to end, so it's better to get a full spectrum of ant bodies while i still have protection from severe symptoms"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Adam Shaheen sucks out loud"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Should I crack a beer? Or wait till fields comes out"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Nuclear level immunity"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: I mean im gonna and it's before noon"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Can't argue with that"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Do I need anything to get the game or is it on cable?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Q level"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: if you have NFL network"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I'm busy making gravy for some biscuits"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: chocolate gravy?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Damnit that's a negatory"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Regular sausage gravy"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Why everyone limping"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: A beer"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: it's a morning beer"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: It's a radler so it's basically juice. Totally acceptable to drink in the AM"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Get Mack Quinn and Hicks outta here for the rest of the game"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Exactly"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Didn't Amazon buy NFL Network rights or something"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: ogletree looking good."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Dude just buy Hulu"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Right now."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Not thrrr"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: You make money"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: There*. Ogletree got smoked"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Yeah that's why I pay a fuck ton for cable"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Wait it's on regular Hulu?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: You should pay a little more and get NFL network"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: I pay for full Hulu"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Ogletree is good again"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Yeah but my wife is retarded and won't let me ditch cable"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Krish youre a couple plays ahead. Hope it catches"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Up"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: This is why you keep cable instead of using Hulu"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: My montucky cold snack is hitting the spot"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: You're bad with money though"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Very true."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Hopefully this series is it for Andy"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Cole also needs to stop jumping over people"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: He's a big dude"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Its fields o'clock"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Tua has looked pretty nice 🎯"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: agreed"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Of course this drive is taking like 10 minutes"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Booooo"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Boom! Fields time!!!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Fields time baby!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Crack another beer"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: What a fuckin handoff. Kid is a star"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Lola Max"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Lolz"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: This game been ass so far"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Okay that was suboptimal"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Man Fields looks human and I've never been so upset"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: He's gotta stop that stupid spin move"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Imagine paying money to watch this live"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: That's how he hurt himself"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: I can't believe we have a locker"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Kicker"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: No kidding. Feels good man"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Who’s the kicker?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Cairo Santos."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: I believe he set the franchise record for most consecutive made last year"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: Didn't he tare is ACL in his first season with another team? And his stock fell because of that and we got him?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: I just remember he had high prospects originally and didn't pan out in fantasy lol"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: Must've been 4-5 years ago though"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Something like that, he got hurt and came back and was trash for a few years"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Injured groin with Chiefs."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: Love to see it"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Took a few years to recover."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: We had him for a bit too"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: Feels good not to have that bad Parkey joojoo..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: that shit was the worst"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: I'm not sure who is still out of the loop, but I'm in the hospital with Covid right guys. Sorry for going MIA for a bit there."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: 10/10 wouldn't recommend covid pneumonia"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Hoping youre on the mend and can get out shortly"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: Yeah, I think I'm on the right track now"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: Just going to be a slow and patient recovery from here, hopefully"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: not exactly looking forward to home oxygen, but whatevs"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: You can wack people with your tank if they talk back though"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: But yeah. Really glad things are improving, even if slowly"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: Yeah. Not going to lie, it got pretty rough the first 3 days in the hospital. Literally felt like I was dying"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Damn"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: Honestly, Trista is a killer nurse. She came and visited on Thursday night and that was a big turn around. She really pushed me on the breathing exercises and stressed how much I needed to get all that garbage out of my lungs. The actual nurses did a piss poor job of explaining all of that stuff and I was just essentially just dicking around with the incentive spirometer before not doing much good."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: That’s great!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: Yeah, I'm a lucky guy not gonna lie"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah. No way to know what it’s going to be like before it happens"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: At least you’re only there ~ a week"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Not like months"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: Yeah for sure."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: Still, a week in the hospital feels a lot longer than a regular week though haha."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: But yeah, I can't imagine being stuck here for a month+"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I can imagine. Sara was in recovery for like 4 days after her bowel resection and even just visiting for those four days felt like a super long time"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Touchdown!!! Fields!!!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: Woooo!!!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: That looked nicr"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: I've gotta say, Fields looks really poised"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Nice**"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Really nice"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: He doesn't seem like he is forcing anything"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Yeah the butterflies gone that drive"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: And throwing to garbage men"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: Yeah, it gives me chills thinking of him connect with ARob"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: connecting*"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Also Mooney, think about how many times he was so open and Mitch just airmailed it"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: He's got wheels dude damn"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: Jets"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Let's fuckin goooooo"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: 🥖"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: I've never over reacted so much to a preseason game but I'm here for it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: We've never had a stunner of a QB before... Just the possibility that Fields can turn into that is something worth being super excited for!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Oh hell yeah"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: https://twitter.com/kingjames/status/1426621394071166978?s=21"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Bron sees it"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Nick Foles is supposed to be a professional QB..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Can make a flamethrower"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: I think I'll stick with being able to breath..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Did they say they were planning to discharge you soon?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: No, haven't really gotten that far yet"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: They like the improvement they are seeing, but I still need to be able to move around with limited o2 drops I think"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Yeah I wouldn't expect them to for a few days yet"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: As of right now, just getting up and taking a few steps drops me to like 80"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: Just comes with time, yeah?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: I think they said the inflammation markers are getting pretty close to being in the good range."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Yeah you can expect slow improvement"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: When someone requires high oxygen like you, it's usually on the order of weeks not days to get back to normal. But I've seen it a lot and most of the time people get off oxygen"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: Good stuff"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: On the bright side, I'm detoxed from all of my bad habits! haha. Booze, caffeine out of my system and I don't think I want to put them back in."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: And I'm sure I've lost some decent lbs. #SilverLining"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: The old fashioned way. No fancy diet, back in the day people lost weight by just contracting dysentery"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Breathe fire?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: https://twitter.com/adamhoge/status/1426667235087691777?s=21"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Exactly!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Cuz he doesn't actually have any lateral movement with it...be just spins and gets clobbered"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Apparently Mitch's first preseason game he went 18/25, 166 yards and TD"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: So was it a bad idea to pull out of Afghanistan... Or not yet?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I don’t think it was necessarily a good idea. There were no good options. So generally I would then err towards not spending billions of more dollars and risking even more American lives."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: But I also think that Biden/the military bungled the pull out. It’s ridiculous that we left behind a bunch of functional drones, MRAPs, and Humvees that the Taliban could take"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: And I think we should have offered green cards or at very least asylum to any Afghan that wanted it"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: It's so fucked that we could have dipped in like 2002 and left Afghanistan in a much better state"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: And facilitated that before withdrawal"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah. I mean I’m fine with staying to we got OBL. Destroying Al Qaeda was necessary and important"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: But post OBL, we didn’t really have a clear goal in Afghanistan"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: At the end of the day I think we can all agree where the real problem started"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Reagan"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I meannnn"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: We do really just fuck up the non-military aspects of these interventions. It’s like debathification in Iraq. The experts in the state department said we absolutely should not do that and then no one with decision making authority listened"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: I just learned that the Burj khalifa has no connection to Dubai's sewage lines"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: So they just have dozens of semis full of shit every day"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Lmao. Sleepy Joe at it again"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Holy shit. That’s really funny and makes no sense"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: So it just goes into like an above ground septic before they truck it out?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Yes exactly"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: There’s like a shit and piss storage closet in the basement or something. Lmao"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: There's a continuous line of trucks being filled with shit and driven out, 24/7/365"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: The Brown Line"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: That’s so funny but also I would expect nothing less from Dubai"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Just the pure artificialness of the solution"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Like we're building this $2billion sky scraper, should we make sure we build out the sewage system to reach it? Nah we're good, that'd delay the project by a couple months"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: We can instead just pay millions of dollars forever to truck out the shit nonstop"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: They probably have some Indian slaves doing it"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: 100% that's who's doin the driving"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Dubai fuckin sucks. We should have invaded them instead of Afghanistan"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Then we could have abruptly pulled out and left a bunch of Lamborghinis for the Taliban to drive back to their caves"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I think if you drone strikes the shit trucks it’d just be so awful they’d give up"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Imagine they're using lambos to haul the shit away"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Why not when you’re that loaded"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: https://twitter.com/dosomemolly/status/1426352173940572162"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Audio in the tweet. It’s so funny"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: My favorite one is still David guetta's George Floyd tribute"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Oh yeah. This doesn’t come close to that"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: That whole video is filled with comedy gold"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: It’s a penis!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: This dude's feed is trash. The only good in it is this nugget"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Well Schmitty has seen every tweet in the Twitterverse that's how he's able to find these"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Finally something that replicates faster than Wikipedia"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: There are so many great candidates to choose from to replace Newsom"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Papagan has my vote"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: His address is “6727 1/8 Hollywood Blvd.”"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: What’s not to love?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: what kind of Harry Potter ass address"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: The real candidate"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: You gonna vote for her?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: She's definitely in my top 3 at the moment."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Behind Newsom and who else?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: What a bitch move"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: That blows"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Idk who these people are. I hate them tho"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: She probably does"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: There's evidence growing alright"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Is the application for California governor like one picture and a free form text box? Who the fuck are these people"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: That they're dumbasses"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: It’s Bret Weinstein, Joe’s bud"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Search YouTube"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Former bud?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Maybe you need a petition with a minimum of one signature and one of the signatures has to be your mom"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Lol like Chris Christie?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: What a tool"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I think literally anyone can be elected Governor during a recall"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: And his wife, cause they ‘cast together"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Looking for new opportunities?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: In this case i don't know what you're abbreviating"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I'm recalling Newsom solely because he closed beaches and the adjacent ocean"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: They’re definitely two people who would take a position like “there may not be definitive evidence that ivermectin works, but there’s absolutely no evidence that it doesn’t work.”"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I’d let Max be governor"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: podcast"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Please don't recall Newsom... I don't want Jenner to be governor"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Your votes will cancel each other out, it’s ok"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: P’cast"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Medical care should be posited the same as the flying spaghetti monster religion. Couldn't agree more"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Like all of my voting in CA, I highly suspect he won't be recalled"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: The couple that casts together stays together"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: The people of CA want socialism too badly to vote for freedom"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I wonder if they’ll just stick to cancel culture or find a new grifty topic du jour"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Bret claims he’s a pretty big liberal. It’d be funny to have him good far for expanding the welfare state"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: But then he’d lose like 80% of his current audience."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Jonas should be in a perfect spot to favor capitalism. Accumulated his student loans in Midwestern dollars and will be paying them off with People's Republic of California dollars"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Seems reasonable"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Jonas just hates transgenders for no reason"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Hey I believe anybody can be a dick."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Let me guess, you voted for an old white dude for president too"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Real \"progressive\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Eh you play the hand you're dealt"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I'm so woke I vote purely on their gender and race now"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Time to take down the white man"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Just tired of having people over the age 70 run the country."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: These are the people who die when they fall and break a hip."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: When did the Jenner become young again?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Sorry, bad reading comprehension"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Lol"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Well I knew you'd hate her just because you've been duped by the girl has a penis thing"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Yeah it's the sort of thing where you'd be like \"anyone is better than newsom\" but all these people are so much worse somehow"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Except, of course, for papagan"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: All right, looks like I know who to vote for now"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Papa Gan’na Clean Up California"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Dying"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: papa gan"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Why is he always so sweaty? Is it the 20 pizzas a week?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Cocaine?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Is there any requirement you have to use your real photo or could this really be a back door Papa John campaign?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: They don't want the wrath of the slickback"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I just think it's funny the thing that made the final push for him to get recalled was him getting caught at that party meanwhile the whole time it was known he'd lock down CA then head over to his mansion in Montana"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: To jonas's point about old ppl in government, it's insane to me that people in their 70s and 80s still want to be in Congress"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Dianne feinstein is almost fuckin 90 and more senile than Biden"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Like imagine being one of her advisers and just keeping on letting her go to work where she doesn't know that's going on"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: It's basically elder abuse"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Charge each one of her voters with it too"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Unfortunately she's got a whole staff depending on her for their jobs. They're going to keep their cash cow mooing"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: *insert weekend at Bernie's picture again*"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: At least I'm pretty sure they hire their own staff"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah. It’s totally fucked that their unelected staff are basically de facto congresspeople"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: It would eliminate some of the perverse incentive if the staff just came with the seat. Sure would be weird as fuck though if her old staff ended up working for a tea party candidate later."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: They do"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: On another \"do as I say not as I do\" note, Rachel's step mom bought a religious book for James and Rachel just crossed out \"God\" in it 😂"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=RGztRPL3Wcc"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: \"Write the bills or get in the bread lines\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: I love this show"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: We need to get back to the original system where president runner up is VP"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Lol. That’d be so weird"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Also, the way that we do it that’s technically still true"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: I recall an interview where they were asked about whether the characters were going to change with the times, and they basically said \"these characters don't even represent us. They're totally morally bankrupt degenerates, which makes them timeless\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Lmao can you imagine if trump was bidens vp"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Shit would be HILARIOUS"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: That's sitcom stuff"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: EXACTLY"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yikes"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Damn it. I had a connect through Kabul next week. Now I have to rebook, I guess"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Woof"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Norton missed a terrorist attack in Istanbul by half an hour one time"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Wtf why no gif"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Whatever fucking technology"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: We're pretty convinced we're not making it to Italy in 2 weeks"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Because of your connection through Kabul?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Or a legitimate issue?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Rona policy?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I dunno, have you heard of COVID?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Lol. Well you replied to a tweet about Kabul"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Kind of a big deal the last 1.5 years"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I'm pretty sure it's been on Twitter"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: It's not like the taliban is spreading covid with their bullets. They're socially distant"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Good cure too"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Honestly very kind of them to not engage in hand to hand combat - to limit the spread"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Aren't they sweet?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Hijabs are basically the ultimate mask mandate. I see the vision."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Sharia law was ahead of its time"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: For real though, sorry about the Italy trip"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Halal food prep was actually ahead of its time. It was more humane than whatever the fuck else they were doing"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Sara and I are having to decide about our honeymoon week"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Leaning towards staying stateside just because it’s low risk and then we can go international next year"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Spend the time in Cider, i hear it's nice"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Man lack of oxygen really fucks with the brain"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: There's still hope but the trend hasn't been good"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: That's how a honeymoon should be"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah. I just don’t want to get invested in going somewhere and then have it not turn out or, possibly worse, be able to go and then not be able to do anything"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: I walk the walk"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Ngl. Took me a sec"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Might wind up going to Commiefornia"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: To get endoctrinated and what not"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: *indoctrinated"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Also, try to go to The French Laundry"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Maybe we’ll run into Newsom"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: We have ads right now encouraging us to vacation but stay in the state"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: There's one around flint"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: To be fair, your state is big as fuck"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: I'm still goin to Italy next week. What am I gonna do, get covid again?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Recall him for spending your money on those ads"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I also want to go to Chez Panisse"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: I'm gonna try to go to French laundry for surbhi's birthday in January"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Idk what she's gonna be doing but that's what im gonna do"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I was supposed to eat at Blue Hill at Stone Barns last April. Still miffed that didn’t happen. Maybe next year"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Got renamed to just \"The Laundry.\" Legit one of my favorite restaurants"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I’ll tell Newsom to come back in Jan. to give her a special birthday surprise when I see him"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Looks good"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Why not \"the freedom laundry\"?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: The biggest win is that we sat on our hands until Canada did the right thing. I'm proud of them"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Posted two days ago"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: I hate when HR writes the job description. No one else would say \"the incumbent\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Uhhh no thanks"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: But the sequel to 13 Hours could be your story!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: 14 hours"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: What are you doing for the COVID test? We bought some home tests to bring with us"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: That's what we're doing too"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Krishnan’s just going to yell at them that he’s a doctor until he’s on multiple no fly lists"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Also remember you have to schedule video proctoring for the tests"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: What's your availability like on Saturday Sept 11?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Piloting"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Busy not forgetting"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Is everyone good with doing our draft this Saturday? Exact time TBD"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Probably like 8pm CT"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: I'm on call but that's fine"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Thu/Fri also works for the two people who filled out the Doodle"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: What's the plan this year with fantasy?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Same as last year, Dan said he’s in too. I was thinking of raising the buy in to $100, sounded like no one was opposed last time I asked"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Well for one, the buy in has been hit by inflation"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: So who all do we have?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: I'm once again reluctantly doing fantasy again this year even though I lost most interest 😂"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: It’s the same roster as last year"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Joe, Jonas, Roshan, Max, Krish,  Dan"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: Can we do something different with lineups and rosters this time?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: 9 QB fukit chukit"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: Yeah I'm looking for less of that 9Qb shit lol"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: I think we dialed it back to a reasonable 4 QB"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: Way too much to keep track of. Makes it not interesting to me to have to follow so much"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: Would much rather have more normal size rosters and just have a roster limit and have all studs"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: 2 QB with a super flex?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Reasonable"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: This wouldn't work, it would make winning pure random"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: How about complete opposite, IDP?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Lol"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: Since we have half the players of a 12-person League, why not just double the roster for everything?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: That's what we've been doing lol"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: 2 qb, 4 wr, 4 rb, 2 flex, 2 te"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: Yeah but then we always throw in all this super flex and I end up playing four quarterbacks"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: Retarded"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Who's fault is that and how's it working?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Another fun thing would be to have a 3rd flex. Can't be someone who you had on the roster in any other week"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: So youre trying to pick a flyer each week to pop off."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: And then you drop them the next week."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: This is what we did last year:"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: It’s pretty much just “double everything” except one flex is a super flex"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: There is one extra flex and one extra super than what Joe was proposing"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: This all just sounds like bodybuilding supplements to me"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: I’m willing to drop a flex or two but I liked the superflex, it actually wasn’t a given to play a  third QB every week with our PPR rules"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Signal needs a polling feature"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: You also get two BCAAs and one Pre"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: https://twitter.com/ronfilipkowski/status/1426878445913583622?s=21"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Damn Max you wylin"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Lucy hasn't stopped moving, climbing, crawling for 2 hours."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: She keeps trying to kill herself and get into the dog food."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Those are two separate activities?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: There is some overlap"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Sounds very tiring"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: You should teach her to climb though. It’s good for you"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: The only thing I'd send someone to the hospital over would be if they Nassar'ed my kids"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: The right thing to do is nassar them back"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: That’s gotta be fake"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Standard CNN"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: https://twitter.com/msbellows/status/1426968392494317571?s=21"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: This is kinda interesting. I didn't realize the Taliban basically offered to boot bin laden and bush said no"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Alright we’ll draft this Thursday at 8pm CT. I’ll change it from 3 Flex / 1 Superflex to 1 flex / 1 superflex as Joe’s MakeAWish gift. Sound good?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: I don't get it. I don't understand code."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: The code collects your user data whether or not you agree to the setting"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: C'mon man"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: An if/else clause is pretty close to English. Do you understand English?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Sam Berger 2.0"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: https://twitter.com/ap/status/1427256447746838528?s=21"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: At least I never tried to convert anyone"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: This is the sort of shit that makes me almost believe in God, but as a complete dickhead"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Yeah he's barking extremely far up the wrong tree here"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Haiti keeps getting fucked by natural disasters, the other country on the same island divided by an arbitrary line is completely fine"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Nein"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah. That’s such a weird part of it. DR seems so lucky"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Sounds like someone who’s just too embarrassed to submit to our lord and savior, Jesus Christ"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: I know this isn't the best segue, but if you ever want to hear a serious, non-dogmatic explanation about God that you've probably never contemplated, let me know. It's good stuff once the light bulb goes on and you view the topic through a different lens. I'll be the first to acknowledge that the evangelical Christian types are one of the biggest roadblocks in the way for scientifically minded people to believing in God. Also, God has a man in the sky type figure is absolute bullshit and is in all intense and purposes a straw man that makes people like yourself look down on believers. Hopefully someday I might be able to help open some of your eyes in some way shape or form on this topic. 🙏🏻"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: In Joe’s defense, he did only bring it up when someone else invoked God"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: So still far away from Sam imo, for the time being…"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: Not today huh?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: I had a 3 hour drive back from UofI with Sam. I couldn't leave"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: #WorthTheTry"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Now that sounds like the Nassar way"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Also a bad segue, but the preview text stopped at \"non-dog\" and i really needed to find out what was next"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: I don't really look down on believers. I said this last time we talked about it, I'm just so agnostic as to be apathetic"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: I can't legitimately appreciate that stance. That's pretty much where I was until my late 20's"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Alternately described\nIf strSrch(previewText, \"non-dog\") > 1 { interested(); }"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: What are you code illiterate, you can write it just not read it?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Reader's block"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Congratulations Master Carter"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Oh i never finished it. The extra workload was killing me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: But I'm assuming we've all met someone who was so unwilling to look outside their skillset that even the simplest pseudocode would lead to \"oh i can't do that\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: I took a python course in undergrad and decided it wasn't for me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Did you take it the Nassar way? "}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Not gonna lie. Not sure totally sure I know what you mean by that."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: There are many ways to be taught about the python"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: He means 🥖"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: My mentor in residency was trained by Nassar back in the day. So it really screwed with him when all of the stuff came to light about what kind of dbag he was."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Holy shit"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: And no he wasn't trained that way."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Yeah he was an athletic trainer at Michigan State and Nasser was a big influence on him going in to medicine."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Sounds like Nassar was very persuasive"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: That's wild"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Lot of commentary on kid molestation in the group chat today. Maybe we do need Joe's lecture on God"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Joe really should pray for Krishnan at least"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Why me? I'm no more a heathen than the rest of you chucklefucks"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Past transgressions? Fair enough though. I’ll take a prayer."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: I made up for it with present good works, I'm Gucci now"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Patent law isn't getting you into heaven"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: True"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I’ll just get rich and then give all my money to Joel Osteen and then I’m good?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: That's exactly how it works."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: It is really unfortunate that those people exist"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Giving Christianity a bad name and abusing people financially"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I want to be Joel Osteen"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I'll start a pay for prayer program. The more you pay, the higher the odds of your prayers getting answered!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Let's not forget Jesus was a Jew"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Start a crypto ChristCoin"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: \"No\" says God to child with terminal cancer"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Prayer answered."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: That swings pretty hard"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Finally read this lol."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: So 0100 Zulu time?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Yes?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: I prefer Moloch time"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Max is too far gone in the military industrial complex"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: 436,117,076,900,1043 seconds after big bang"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: That looks like a surprisingly small number just off the cuff."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: How I feel like I can count that high!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: Hell* I feel"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: I’m probably missing some zeroes"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Maybe, maybe not. Humans are bad at large numbers"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: But my guess would be yeah, you need another factor of 1000 or so"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: I meant interstellar seconds, which is normal seconds times exactly the factor I’m off by"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: 🤣🤣🤣"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: Good news dudes, I just passed my walking test to go home with oxygen. Still up to the docs but I am ecstatic to potentially sleep in my own bed tonight! 🥳"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Spoken like a true physicist"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: That’s great!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: Yeah I'm honestly really surprised. It's crazy how up and down this has been and the difference a day can make."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: https://twitter.com/Breaking911/status/1427335498960343048\n🤦‍♂️"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I mean she’s saying it’s bizarre and that they “seem” friendly, not that they are friendly. I don’t get why people are jumping on her. She’s putting herself at significant risk to do this reporting"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: It's more about CNN just saying CNN things. Akin to insisting how the riots last summer were mostly peaceful. Just absolutely bullshit trash/spin"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: But again. She didn’t say “they’re mostly friendly.” I agree with you to extent about last summer’s coverage but I just don’t see the same thing here. Maybe she could have chosen better words but she’s speaking contemporaneously"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Sorry, extemporaneously"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: Yeah I'm not bashing her really. Just in awe of the situation in Afghanistan right now moreso... Absolutely heartbreaking"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Ragging on CNN's \"bias\"? Now we definitely know that Joe is feeling better."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: If it said that on the chyron then I’d agree with you"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Full recovery"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Getting COVID has somehow only emboldened him"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: LOL"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Biden really fucked up the withdrawal"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Oh no. He's Super Joe now"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Joe+ (the plus is for the antibodies)"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: I find it hard to believe that all of this was done so poorly accidentally. Like, it's just too on the nose... Surreal doesn't begin to describe it all. How in the world could we let this happen in this way? For context, I'm all for getting out of the middle east as a whole. But the way this all went down so fast and so catastrophically badly really has me at a loss for words. Are our military leaders truly that inept?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Same thing happened to Trump"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah. It is mind boggling that the entirety of the government apparatus could fuck it up this badly. Iraq felt that way too."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Isn't he doing a presser like very soon today?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Yeah it's wild. After 20 years, the Taliban ends up stronger and controlling more of Afghanistan than when this all started. The fact that they were able to sweep through Afghanistan in like a week shows that we lost this shit years ago"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: https://www.whitehouse.gov/live/"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: It has begun"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Some madness from reddit"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Fair point. I hadn't heard that. It's still weird that it took this long. It's not like there's some revelation that just happened. The situation's been what it's been for days."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I agree but I'd say there was never really anything to win. The goals of taking out OBL and al Qaeda were clear and we accomplished those. The nation building part had no clear goal and was never going to be accomplished, least of all the way we sort of went about it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: It is honestly insane how quick it all collapsed. total house of cards. There were a bunch of stories a few years back about how corrupt and fucked up the afghan military was, tons of bribery and shit like rape and pedophilia that we just tolerated. Insane stuff."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Yeah if you're watching the press conference, i can't say i disagree with anything I've heard yet"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: E.g. mission wasn't nation building, stop risking American lives for a war the Afghan Army doesn't have the will to fight"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Yup. No denying that the withdrawal shouldn't have been much more better and well organized but I think the right thing to do was to dip the f out"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: That part i can't understand. Planning and organizing logistics is our fucking jam."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Why was that fucked up?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: I honestly think somehow no one saw the collapse bein that quick"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: He did say that they never anticipated it happening this quickly. Afghanistan basically doesn't have roads. Their government collapsed in the time it took for the new dudes to road trip to kabul"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah. There is an element of surreal-ness to the speed. Also, the fact that in a lot of cases they just walked in to a town and no one said anything at all so it was just Taliban territory is unexpected."}

Don't count me out entirely though because it's still three plus weeks away and if I get lucky I might be totally back to normal without oxygen by then, in which case I'd love to still come!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: What's the rough itinerary? Is it totally off grid kind of thing? Or are we staying in a cabin / Airbnb?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Great! No problem. It’s a house with electricity. Haha. No AC I think but it should be cool enough. I just sent an email with details that has a link for the Air BnB. I think we were going to try to go hiking for a while on Friday, at least a group of us, but otherwise it’s just chilling around the house. Figured we’d grill some meat one or both nights, there’s a place for a bon fire etc."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: And there should be cell reception at the house. There is WiFi and if there isn't cell reception at the house there would be nearby. We might go to Lake Placid one night after dinner or for a bit (about 30 min away)."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: ... do you think they're just made that Afghanistan is mandating half their population to wear masks?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: *mad"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Based on last night, seems like a good call"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah. I’m a little ambivalent about reprised indoor mask mandates. Probably helps but idk. It does look like infection rate has peaked in early/severe delta wave regions."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Peaked sure but if we plateau at this rate, hospitalizations keep going up"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Gotta do something to try and stem it and mask mandates are a super benign intervention. Rather that than let it get to the point that they start imposing occupancy restrictions"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Well it looks like Florida, as an example is down around 0.8 after being at 1.5."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Damn it. The preview is terrible. You have to open the image to see the quote tweet"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: But a full backectomy is not good"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Ectomy means to excise. Back is your back."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: You can't excise your whole back"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Well I know that but it could have been colloquial."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I’m normal lawyer dumb"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Not full idiot"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: There is a “lumpectomy,” which also sounds bullshit, so it didn’t seem out of bounds but did seem a step too far"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: By the end of the summer tevan will probably need an actual literal backectomy so don't worry too much schmitty"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Fuck those towel heads"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I'm cheap too that's why I'm so pissed about our 20 year investment in freedom being pissed away"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: He’ll look like Ed from 90 day fiancé. Dude looks like he had a neckectomy"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: https://www.instagram.com/reel/CSsHlgBjqJhrBL-W9NrobPgbJxrrBndZqb5Zko0/?utm_medium=copy_link"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Agreed, Biden is a paper hands bitch"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Our league is 1/2 PPR?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Every year I am less and less ready for fantasy football"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Yeah 1/2 ppr"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Would it take the pressure off if I told you you’re probably going to lose?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: How dare you talk to the back to back champion like that"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: As a former champion myself, I agree that Max deserves more respect"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Lance Lynn, the white Sox pitcher tonight, just got tossed for throwing his belt at an ump"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Krishnan you ever have a resident and thought \"man I was never that stupid as a resident\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Oh yeah. Like frequently"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: On Monday, my resident tried to accept a patient to the ICU cause the pulse ox was reading like 50% on 15L."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: The lady had acrylic fake nails on and the pulse ox was just not reading"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Lolol"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Also she died 3 minutes later?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: I told a resident \"hey this girl is gonna be sick, watch out and let me know when MRI is done\"\n\nHe doesn't tell me when its done and when he looks at it doesn't think anything we need to go after surgical. Meanwhile she gets admitted to picu in compensated septic shock and has a huuuuge periosteal abscess. So when i randomly work up at 4 am I looked it up myself and saw she was crumping. I called and woke him up to take this girl to surgery right then..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Like dude. Fucking call your attending. Also you suck at MRIs."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Very rarely in Ortho do we get to do life saving stuff...but this is one that coulda ended up bad."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Glad you were her angel 2day"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: I got over a pint of pus out. It was awesome."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Can't trust none of these fuckers"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: That’s not awesome. That’s gross as hell"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Welcome to my life."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Is the draft order set for tomorrow yet?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: The default is 30m before draft"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Also it's a 6 person draft with 39 rounds so it doesn't matter"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: You’re only saying that because you rigged it"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: You can’t prove that"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: It could just randomly go in the order that I like each of you"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: #1 goes to me!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Lol. I meant Jonas is only saying order doesn't matter because he rigged it"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: You're unimpeachable, Roshan"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Should be based on number of Alexandra Plattos dating attempts"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: So Roshan and I are easily first 2 picks"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: I like how it couldn’t go in the order of who knows the most Japanese"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Because Jonas does bonsai now and Dan’s a wildcard"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: But does he imawa nanji desuka?!?!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Lol. I have a meeting tomorrow now so I'll only be there first half probably"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Do i have to join the league now?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I mean the stadium is right next to Mandalay Bay"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Dude"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Make that rule for the hospital tbh"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Our hospital has a rule for visitors now. Vaccine or negative test within 2 days"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Why even write a headline like that when more characters are free? This isn't print media"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Most of the way there. Just drop the part starting with “or”"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Sure if the tests are always fast and better if on-site"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: I learned that the vaccine is undoubtedly why my dad is alive, but restrictive covid policy nearly killed him"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: In September the hospital made him wait 2 days with an asthmatic cramp while his covid test results came back, so when he was finally allowed in, he collapse on the way in the doors and was placed in a medically induced coma"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Wow. Sorry to hear that. Glad he pulled through"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: To your point, the restrictions here are on visitors"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I mean this is for visitors. No reason you should be able to get by with a two day old test. You want to visit in person? Be vaccinated or get a dose in person then"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Otherwise you can FaceTime or whatever from outside the hospital"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: I guess I'm just sensitive to any reassuring that might limit access to care, or even end of life moments."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah. I understand that but it takes <2 min to get a dose. And if you really want you can be a little lax on enforcement for true end of life situations"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: My brother Scott allegedly skipped my wedding because his wife's ingrown toenail removal kept getting pushed back, but I'm like 100% sure it's because he would have had to wear a tyranny mask to fly here"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Sure but that dose doesn't change anything in a couple minutes"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Lol that is quite an excuse"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Haven't wilfully spoken since"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: You almost have to respect how he picked the most minor sounding medical problem possible"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: I was gonna go to your wedding but I've been stopped up for a couple days"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I agree but the net gain in public health is big. I’d be fine with dose + on site test too."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: I'm pleased that the test results come back immediately now. Lil man got tested a couple weeka back on account of this RSV and they had it back before we were done with pur first nebulizer rodeo"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: The rapid antigen test at home takes 15 minutes too"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Surbhi and I have done a bunch recently"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Some time last year, one of Emily's employees had a close call and couldn't come to work for 4 days while she waited for her results"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Mr. Moneybags over here buying tests left and right"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Still trying to figure out of it's transmissible through semen?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: \"I'm not stopping until you're positive for something, dammit!\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah. It’s crazy that that was a thing. Claire Herdeman volunteered on Election Day and decided to self-isolate until her test taken the next morning came back and it took 6 or 7 days…"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Lol well we tested her like every other day cause she's on service on the heme/onc floor with a bunch of immunocompromised patients. I tested twice, once when I became mostly asymptomatic which was positive and on Tuesday which was negative"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Wanted to be sure I'm testing negative before going to Italy and getting stuck there lol"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Yeah when this first started it took a full week, we'd just have patients with suspected covid on the service and transfer them to regular ICU after a week when their test came back"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: And it was a send out test, so one time it got lost and we had to wait two weeks total after we figured that out and resent it"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Insane"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Also"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: I'm not into ebony though"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: You bitch, this was a setup for \"well you're in luck!\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: It's Frank's birthday today, in case anyone forgot"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: It's over for the Squad now."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I forgot"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Goddamn dude check a calendar before trying to jihad yourself"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah. I hope he gets help. Too bad nothing about everything that prompted to feel that way will change."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Ouch. I stand by the statement too. Overreach for one group doesn't mean we should promote overreach for the other. And it doesn't mean I don't think he shouldn't be punished for what he did do."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I saw polling from recently that Americans think domestic terrorism is more of a threat than foreign terrorism. That held true across the political spectrum as well, which is encouraging."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Close!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: What cause is he talking about?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Idk really. He had apparently liked a bunch of fairly far right wing pages on FB, like White Lives Matter type stuff, but then he's just talking about \"freedom\" generically."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: So I guess like typical Don't Tread on Me stuff"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: There's some references to medical care for veterans, if I'm reading it correctly"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: It saddens me that this is the only way this guy thought he could get a message of justice across. That's a man who wants justice."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah. There's way too much violent rhetoric out there"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: That clip earns a solid 8 “c’mon man”s"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Petty as it is, I'd like a more substantial tasteless clip from faux news before i get worked up."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Isn’t that the only reason people use OnlyFans?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: That or they're looking to buy decorative ceiling fans"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah. It seems to be a weird decision."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: That was pretty much tank their business"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: I assumed it was a joke"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I think a lot of people did but it's been confirmed in the press now"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: What else do they do?!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: The “creator economy” is a big thing right now so I’m guessing they want to expand to non porn creators"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: A lot of hoes are about to be broke again"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: It roughly in the order of how religious we are"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: When is it kosher to start calling him Covid Joe?"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Pretty good tbh"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Better than ￼"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: I think the autodraft gets pretty confused by 26 rounds"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Joe picked up defenses in like the 15th and 16th"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Idk. Sounds smart to me"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Also, lmao. Elon Musk announced Tesla will be making some sort of humanoid robot but instead of just saying it or have a partial prototype, he paid a guy to be in a spandex bodysuit and walk on stage like the robot will eventually"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I hate when people threateb"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Good question"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I am him. He is me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: What happened to Original Max then?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Lol. Congrats to the dumbasses who made this a thing."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Did you eat him?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: He got fat"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Most were mild symptoms but one was bad enough that they advised him to seek immediate medical attention"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Glad someone figured it out"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Seems like a very normal dude"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Just a real upstanding community leader"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Might have to re-rename the group text"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: yup"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Literally what I called when we drafted him"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: What did you guys expect from the NVP?"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: They’re like those annoying motorcycle gangs"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: We should send them back to Afghanistan"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Fields had a good day again though"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: But our OL and receivers were trash as usual"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Yeah the receivers didn't help his case there but only two of his incompletions were on him I'd say"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: https://twitter.com/jasonlieser/status/1429186615449202688?s=21"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: On the one hand, if our oline is terrible it’s better to sacrifice The Rocket"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: But Fields is also obviously better so far"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Yeah but if our line is terrible andy will die"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: And if he dies, fields comes out there anyway"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: But then there’s one less ginger in the world?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: So this group is still showing up as \"Titty kisser watch party\" which made for an interesting conversation with Rachel when she was sending herself pictures from my phone"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Was the name inspirational?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Where did the titty kissing come from? That was the part I didn't have the full background on"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I'll let you know tomorrow, but highly doubtful"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: We renamed it for Trubisky"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Cuz he loves kissing titties"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I knew that much, but there's not a deeper back story?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Krishnan wanted to watch Mitch"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: In high school Trubisky tweeted it. Reddit was far more useful than you. Just like WebMD."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Oh you didn’t know where the kissing titties thing came from? That must have been awkward"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: It’s like his origin story"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: You guys ever read Nick Mullen's IMDB page?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I was confused why a backup QB had a IMDB page"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: I’m more interested in that laser studded baseball cap"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: What kind of lasers regrow hair? Is the idea that you just wear the cap for months?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Also how do lasers both remove and regrow hair? Health science is so weird"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Stimulates blood flow. Same thing for injuries"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Is Dr Simone gold your aunt??"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: No she just shared that"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: There is actually a concept of medical apartheid or vaccine apartheid, but its not related to unvaccinated people being disallowed to attend a Travis Scott concert or some shit"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Are you referring to experimentation or access to care? I was expecting an access difference, but the results point to experimentation"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Friday afternoon"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Did they stress that you’re supposed to take Human Ivermectin?"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Lol. No typos there"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Can confirm"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: What’s a prone team?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: We turn patients on their belly"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: My only guess was butt doctors but I don’t know why there’s a team of them or why they’d need to be bringing the muscle"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: It takes like 3 ppl minimum"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Where you find that"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: It is funny that people are getting all worked up about the new attractive congresswomen"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Boebert is way crazier than AOC"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Like I think a sizable percentage of the AOC hate is just people wanting to fuck her but not knowing what to do with those feelings because she's a democrat"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: It's kinda fucked that Trista has Joe's phone and has to see all our dumbass conversations about the best colon emoji"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: I rate their racks at too close to call"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah and he's got those boomer notifications going for Signal too. Must be annoying"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: In general, how much misogyny is just driven by sexual frustration?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: It's got to be like 70% sexual frustration, 20% illegitimate professional frustration, 10% legit professional frustration"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah. That sounds about right to me"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: At least in general relative contribution."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I just walked by someone singing a song with truly insane lyrics. A jazz song. “Every time I touch you, you tremble inside / when I try to kiss you, there’s nowhere you can hide.”"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Without trista reading it, I'm reminded of the time Robin Thicke got canceled and divorced over \"blurred lines\" meanwhile all the rappers it featured walked away from it like nothing happened. In fact, Pharrell put out happy and capitalized on it like crazy"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Plot twist: the actual lyrics are innocuous and this person just thinks those are the lyrics and is totally on board with it"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Lool. He was giving like a public performance so that would make the twist extra funny"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: I assumed it was someone singing along to themselves"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: It was like a jazz trio playing in front of some benches"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: With a PA system"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: She probably won't let him talk to us ever again now"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Over butt stuff? Nah"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: WWJD"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Over our lack of godliness"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: We only acknowledge the civil liberties of women, homos, immigrants,  and coloreds on this chat anyway. She doesn't know about our most egregious unamerican transgressions"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Since you’ve lived in three time zones, which one is best, purely from a time perspective?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: East is the worst but had the longest days."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Best coast obviously"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Pacific is awesome for TV and sports."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: There's a reason it's called the best coast"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Would have hated it in college. When I had to set an alarm to watch a noon game."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Yeah when I first moved out here I definitely missed kick offs"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: The idea of sleeping in until 10 now blows my mind"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: But now I'm up for like 4 hours before kickoff so it's perfect"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Wow. It’s nuts that the payment got that high. Just 4-5 years ago it was in the low billions."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: $AAPL prints money like the USG"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: You were sleeping when you should have been grinding 😤😤"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Think of how many calls you could have bought in those hours you slept"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Max, since you’ve said you travel to the East Coast for work, does the time difference bother you for that at all?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: That being work generally, sorry"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Not the travel itself"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: 0. Football is on Sunday dummy"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I just wake up at 0600-0630 EST when I travel so I shock my system into east coast time"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I also try to wake up at 0500 PDT most of the week so the adjustment has never been that rough now that I'm old and with children"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Also I confirmed via Instagram kichu is in Italy"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: So he's probably sleeping or some weak as non grinding shit 😤"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: That’s so early. Haha"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Can you not put in orders on the weekend?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Know why I'm up that early? BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT. STAY HARD!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: That’s why he’s poor 💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I’m very not up that early. I need to fix my schedule now that Sara lives with me"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Though it’s not so bad the first year since she’s busy."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: You typing a Joe level post over there?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Yeah if you always chat late with us it means you stay up too late"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I've never tried but maybe you could? I've been somewhat of a day trader over the last 3 months and markets have to be open and bouncing for that. I also do it without internet access at my desk which makes it more challenging"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Unfortunately I don't wake up at 4am when you guys start going at it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Up by 5"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah. That’s an annoying part of the job"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: ^@max"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Lol. Maybe. I usually go to bed at midnight and get up around 7:15"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: A couple times a year I just stay up all night, usually because I’m doing something that must be done for a client based in Europe so I can’t just get up in the morning and do it"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: We're dreading the Italy time change. +9 from here, I could swing it in a couple days but who knows how the kids will do"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah. That’s a big one"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: When do you leave?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: You lawyers and your great hours."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Next Tuesday at 0700 out of SD which means getting to the airport by 0530"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: So that should be a good start to the shift lol"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: As much as I work, I love that my schedule is mostly entirely flexible"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Including that I don’t have to be anywhere at 6 am"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: OR starts at 730 so if you want to do anything before that or if you have resident teaching, gotta be early."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah. Pass"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Must be nice to be a kid forever"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Lol. 🤷🏽‍♂️"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Peter Pan, esquire over here"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: James just performed back surgery on me with a chainsaw so ￼ you need to step your game up"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: He didn't even need to spend umpteen grand to learn how to do it"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I didn't heal very well from my first one so he had to go back in"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: He also had to rush out of this surgery to poop so he might turn out like Jonas"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I love that parents have to say “thank you” to their kids for the dumbest shit in order to teach you manners"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: *them manners"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: The “oh thank you” had me dying"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: \"Please\" is borderline impossible for them to say unprompted for stretches of time. I feel like the less likely he knows it is to happen the more likely he is to use it without being asked to"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: \"Give me milk!\" Vs \"please may I eat all the candy in the pantry please?\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Hahaha"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Not the worst lesson…"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Goalball aka what I'm calling blind ball in the Paralympics is fucking wild"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Hadn't heard of it. Would play. Where are you watching the paralympics?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: They have to be visually impaired, tape their eyes, and wear blackout goggles"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Is it on NBC also?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: A penalty throw may be awarded for \"touching eyeshades without permission.\" Lol"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Goalball what a stupid lazy fucking name"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Most sports are goal ball"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Have you ever considered monetizing your ranting?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Don't trade options outside market hours, even if it's possible. The risk is way higher"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: ￼ didn't you fly into Milan, now you're down by Rome?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: It's a small country"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: As a person who's recently planned a trip, I disagree"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Krishnan's childless so it matters less?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Fucking Chip's wedding spot is really inconvenient. Way to get married in some small obscure town that your family is from"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah. Pretty rude"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I feel like if you're going to do that you should basically elope and then just do reception stateside later"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: We're in lake Como, it's 40 minutes by train from milan"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Yeah we're here for a wedding in Perugia which is 2 hrs from Rome the closest city"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Oh where IG tagged you guys was down by Rome."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I'm kinda bummed we're not going to Como but we would've had to go for like 6 weeks to visit everywhere lol"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: That's the nearest cell tower"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Not anymore now that Krishnan’s vaccinated. Now he’s never more than 0 feet from 5G"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Good point. ￼ , you need to go into settings and turn on Romeing. That's three farts and a whistle."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Don't forget. It's live free _or die_"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Also Lufthansa informed me today they're no longer accepting negative COVID tests in Germany (where we layover) and that you have to be vaccinated. So 5 days must be enough time to get fully vaccinated, right?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: And wish signal took inline formatting"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: There's an instantaneous method to ensure you can't get or spread covid, but it's counter to enjoying your vacation 🤲🪒"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: An emptier plane is definitely more enjoyable"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Well that got dark"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: When I went to Egypt, everyone had their own row and it was awesome"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I flew home last summer and there were literally 6-7 of us on a 737."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: But beyond having your own row, the sparseness didn’t mean anything."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: It’s just “early toxins” leaving, nbd!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: How long was the flight to Egypt?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: And the guy considering switching from ivermectin to hydroxychloroquine is also smart. Gotta respond to what your body needs, ya know?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Like 12-15 hours with one layover"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: https://youtu.be/rQHx_GPKccY"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Best to play it safe"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Longer than I would have guessed. Having your own row for that long must have been great"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: The very last question he posed is a good one. How many of the nasty/deadly breakthrough cases are just people who got forgeries registered into databases? I'm sure the combined probability of getting a forged medical record, getting covid, and having it be a severe case is still low enough that most of those cases are real."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: I actually forged a document too to go to Egypt, but it was just a backup because they screwed up my test and I almost didn’t get the results in time"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: It was tough because the test can’t be too old, I needed one that was valid within 48 hours of landing in Egypt"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: I'm watching this documentary \"Korengal\" about some folks in a spot where there were daily firefights, and i forget that there's a real camera crew just stuck in the middle of real firefights all the time"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: I didn’t use the forged one but I probably would have because I’m not a good person"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: gotta pepper some “allegedly”s in there"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Professor Choxi, ethics"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Lesson one: sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Disagree. I think they're more miss than hit these days, but tugging off a dolphin makes me smile"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Part of my issue with SNL criticism is that I think people misestimate how hard it is to put out that much content week after week. Like of course there are duds. They didn't spend a year writing 7 hours of content and don't have the benefit of many continuous plot lines."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I agree that a lot of it misses but there are some pretty good jokes in there"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: The cast just isn't as good as it has been in the past."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah. My point wasn’t that it’s objectively good but that it’s underrated. It’s not terrible but people act like it is"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: \"they\" should be using \"it\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah. I just go with using the person’s name"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: yeah it’s kind of a subtle power move because you can’t tell if it’s one person or many now"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: “they would like you to fill out this report”"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: My gender identity is being three people"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Like do a bunch of people want me to or just one?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: “They would like to fuck you”"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: You just really have no idea what you’re getting into"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: It's a threesomev every time you jerk off!"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Just falling asleep, forehead rolls onto the 0 key, launch a bunch of nukes"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: they obviously should have gone with 42042069. The Russians never would have guessed"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: This reminds me of the people who understand viral spread in terms of their Karen videos bitching at low wage employees but not with respect to actual viruses"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: I just watched a bird fuck up and then eat a praying mantis."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Metal"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: The tough part would be getting people to buy in to the visits that are 21 days apart and getting injected"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Make it 23 days"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Well the 21 days is the regimen we approved but longer seems to work fine too"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Call it a “quarterly whole health maintenance” regimen"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Not getting the J&J vaccine that's for sure"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: And just get them to come in in ~3 months"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: That's why I went with the dick pill vax, can't domesticate me. STAY HARD!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: I wear so much of that shit"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Because you were bad at organic chemistry?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: No cuz my head burns and I unknowingly applied it everyday"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Hats"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Great, now i have to hear about how ivermectin can't hurt in preventing sunburn"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: You better come visit to prepare yourself for the communist takeover"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: You could move here and just not pay rent"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: So dad bros, ￼ ￼ ￼ , you guys start college fund planning? Em and I were looking into it today."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Haven't quite decided whether to underfund with the assumption that the kid will get scholarships or whether to assume he's just smart enough to get in"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Yeah. We have one for Lucy."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: James already has more money saved than I did. I'm using a UTMA but 529 is a good way to go"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: 529 that is"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Are you planning to fund 100% of projected or just somewhere around half?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I went with UTMA purely to cover the case of getting full ride/scholarship/going into the services/etc"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: I looked at utma, decided on 529, and erasedmy memory. What made you choose it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: And I stonk hard"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: 529 is transferable though."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Yeah but what if all my kids find low cost solutions?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: The biggest downside to UTMA is income/assets when they apply for federal aid but there's a 0% chance they were going to qualify"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Just look at you and Khrysta."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Both my parents are fuck ups. Really Lyndsie and I are the outliers"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Are you saying 529 is outside of fafsa?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I don't remember if it counts or not, not being able to really choose the investments turned me off"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Should max and i just take this offline? Perhaps me, Max, and Bo?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Yah Bo is the one to talk to.b"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Probably"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Lol"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: I just make the money"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Let me know if you find a better \"soft boner\" emoji than the wheat"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Steven hawking had his kids after als"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: That answers the question I was working on"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: But if you're paralyzed below the waist don't you not feel anything?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: not necessarily"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: 🍌🥒"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: It wasn't his spine. It was his nervous system"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: I did see that one of them read messages"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I keep forgetting to check that"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: A drug allergy alone could mean life or death"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Yeah nevermind they saw it yesterday after I texted"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: So make sure to try lots of drugs before you get sick!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Are you wearing spf rated hats?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Unless Larry Elder wins"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I have a 529 for myself to transfer over once I have kids"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Bitch i didn't ask you! Come back after you've procreated!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Don’t get mad cause I’m"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Planning way ahead"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Taking advantage of as much compounding as I can"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: I've heard Ron Jeremy could do an even 10 second count down before he came. Schmitty has the foresight to fund a 529 before he does"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I don’t stonk anywhere close to as hard as Max, so the choices don’t really bother me. You don’t have to choose your state’s 529 if you want different choices. You just don’t get the tax bennies"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah this Trista checking Joe’s phone thing is throwing me off. At least before we sort of knew (or maybe just inaccurately assumed) that Joe was doing well enough to read the messages even though he wasn’t responding"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Which for MA aren’t that great right now anyway"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Not that I could have opened a custodial account instead"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: I guess i still assumed he checked them"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: But the penalty is only 10% so it seems worth the risk that your kids don’t go if you otherwise like the 529"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Like i figured he keeps our chat on mute and thus doesn't have notifications for her to follow"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I can do the same thing... I just have to start it before I enter"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Unless she just pulls it up like \"what did these commies say now?'"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I hope she’s reading each post aloud to Joe bedside"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Ah fuck now she's going to tell everyone I cum in less than 10 seconds. I played myself!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Joe’s not going to want to fuck you anymore"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: I'm just thinking about her reading all the emojis aloud"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I rewatched Central Intelligence last night. I forgot how good it was"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson plays the character so well"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: In reference to a colonoscopy: worm emoji, monocle emoji"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: He's a funny guy"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Are you binging through Rock movies?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Not particularly but watching San Andreas did inspire me"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I hope she reads the reacs too"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I watch a lot of movies in the background while I work since it usually helps me focus"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: The rock/Kevin Hart combo is good"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Ah yes another psychopath"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Better than Kumail/Dave Bautista though that movie was also enjoyable for me"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Who’s the first one?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: I tried watching Jungle Cruise last week and it wasn’t very good, but it’s also a kids movie"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Wasn’t he in one of the Mummies?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: That one looked bad bad"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: So it’s good to know it’s not worth it"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Oh dude Baywatch, that was pretty good"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Scorpion king"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yes. Very"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Rachel does annoying shit like this too"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Glad to have a compatriot. You’re flat wrong to call it annoying. 😤😤"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: I'm convinced he doesn't sleep. When he gets time to rest, he goes bass fishing"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Max works in a level 4 sound isolation chamber"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: An anechoic chamber so good you can’t stand up in it"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: You ever work in an anechoic chamber? It's eerie"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Makes you focus more on the work"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I’ve never been. Always wanted to go sometime"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: I heard it’s physically impossible to stay in a certain level of sound isolation"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Or psychologically impossible"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: And you can hear all your internal body sounds"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: There's probably a creepypasta about it"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I don’t know the ins and outs but I know there are ones that are so good that you actually can’t really stand up anymore"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Because there’s not enough noise for you to balance yourself"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Maybe it has to be dark too for that but the anechoic is part of it at least"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Also, Carter, it sounds like you have been?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: I thought the inner ear was a fluid level. Just needs force (gravity, usually)"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Worked in testing for years. Lots of hemi-anechoic chambers"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/earths-quietest-place-will-drive-you-crazy-in-45-minutes-180948160/"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: This article mentions trouble walking/standing in the really good ones"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: The headline also addresses Roshan’s point"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: The best one i was ever in was for exhaust catalyst aging, so the floor was vertical metal grate and beneath it was more sound damping material. You could absolutely hear your own bodily functions"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Which ones did you hear?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Mostly heartbeat, but a little stomach"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I've been working to ambient white noise generators since I moved to San Diego 5 years ago"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: John deere has one with a solid bedplate floor that's big enough to drive a combine into. It's not super quiet, but it's the size of a house"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Lol how is that less psychopathic than putting Dwayne Johnson movies on in the background?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Lmao"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Is that a nice way to talk about your family?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: One of the partners puts on 10 hour train videos or waves videos."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: I tried whale songs once"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: meh"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Stopped after the fifth fap break?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: We literally have white noise generators at work so you can't hear inside the classified space. It's really annoying too"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Also it's what we play on the sound machines for the kids so now I can't sleep without some sort of white noise paying"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Lol. Couldn’t just spring for the noise isolation?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Easier to blast white noise"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Capitalism, babyyy"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Yeah they just some hire some immigrants to make the sounds with their mouths"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: You have to hire way too many immigrants to use them for sound isolation"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Contract promised security, sales guy alluded to sound proof, project team installed loud speakers with white noise"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Buddyyy... you can't use immigrants in ITAR work"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: They should play the audio of all the terrorists being killed by your products"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: As white noise AND motivation"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Gotta use prisoners. They're the secret to slave labor"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: True good point"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Dark"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah. That’s true and so incredibly fucked"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: You can also pay less than minimum wage if you can prove they're retarded"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Or use waiters and waitresses but don't tip"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: You can to of you want them to sing a particular tune... or if they get your coffee order just right"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: *tip if"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: The wages while in prison are abhorrent but it’s also absolutely insulting that they can’t do the jobs they were doing in prison once they get out"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Like they do some of the most dangerous work to fight wildfires in CA while incarcerated and then can’t qualify to be a firefighter after they’re out"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Well a lot of people don't qualify"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: It's actually really hard to get into LAFD"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I mean that they can’t qualify"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Yeah but my point is normal non criminals don't qualify either"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: But they have the chance to"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: They’re not strictly disqualified. They’re assessed on their merits at least."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Well so did the criminals pre crime"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: So you’re suggesting that criminals shouldn’t be able to find jobs, even ones their highly qualified for, because of their past, even though they’ve served the punishment that society deemed necessary?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Max stop"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Before you proceed, Schmitty made a minor grammar error"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Fuck him up"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Their"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Wrong they're, whole statement is void"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Even the illiterate guy got it!"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I'm much better at the guy who doesn't give a shit but throws the conversation off course role"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Well, anyway, I think that’s profoundly unjust and only promotes recidivism."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Great only reason, you shellfish"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: And because he's a father?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Not everything in America is recidivist Schmitty"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Maybe?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Lol"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Backpedaled compassion. Save it for twitter, Maximus 'Canceled' Schwanebwck"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Rough!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Ok that’s funny"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Pretty proud of myself"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Can't stop thinking about how jonas looked like an Asian girl at 6 months"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Bio dad is fake bio dad. Real bio dad is an Asian guy"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Fucking lame! My tomatoes were almost ready!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: It tells you what the weather is going to be the day before, so if you didn’t prepare for the hurricane, that’s on you"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: What game is this?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I am not a closet gay-mer"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: I'm ruined!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: What was i going to do, Jonas? Bring them inside?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Harvest moon"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: V tru"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Harvest moon 64 one of my top 5 games of all time"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Carter you played Stardew Valley?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Now the bonsai thing makes more sense."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Not that it needed to"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I hope we're waking Krishnan up"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: This is the OG snes version"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: I've been doing all grind and not looking for a wife yet though😤😤"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Smart. Hoes before hoes"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Hose before hoes too"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: lol"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Stardew is not in the harvest Moon franchise bit it's very similar. It's like a knockoff but takes all the best stuff from the games and makes it better. It's on a bunch of platforms."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Haven't gotten that upgrade yet"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: A couple doses of Pfizer and you'll get there"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: I love the subtle mechanics of the game"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: When you're single, you can get infinite shit done at night. Once you're married, your wife gets pissed if you work past dark and you'll never have a kid... unless you marry the girl you met at the bar... then she'll still get preganté"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Bar girl is Karen in that one right?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Karen was always the best"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Eve?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Don't marry a Karen"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Guys"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: What if Joe caught COVID a year ago, and has been in a coma this whole time"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: And we’ve been talking to Trista this whole time"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Trista's got really intense opinions about inflation"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Jesus dude i thought you had horrible news"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Potentially!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: I’m just asking questions"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Thanks for clarifying with a picture"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Bret Weinstein style"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: What if we all got covid and have been in a coma this whole time"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: 🐋💦"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Joe Rogan"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I saw a clip with Bret Weinstein and Jordan Petersen (Peterson?) today where they both open endedly questioned whether the field of medicine does more harm than good"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Whatever just get me that third leg"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: We'll find out if Trista shows up to my bachelor party in two weeks"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Oh boy. I bet Joe does not make it to the party, comrade"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: He was questionable pre round 2"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: He sent me a pretty manic email about driving there together right before he got hospitalized again"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Remember when he bought thousands of N95 masks looking to profit off the pandemic?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: How much do you care about privacy?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: ☹️"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah. For sure. I was doubtful but I didn’t want to be like “you’re uninvited”"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Between that and options trading, i got the impression that 2020 was a million dollar year for him"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: If he makes it through, he'll have some sick antibodies"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Then he claimed he donated them, right?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: He said he tried to but no one would take them"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Ah bummer"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Some, but places wouldn't take them over chain of custody"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: / santitation"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: A lot were moldy"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Mold could be the secret thing that fights COVID!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Worked for bacterial infections"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: It’s irresponsible to not try mold"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Intellectually dishonest"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Suspicious even"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Nah but if anything were to give credence to \"masks make you sick!\" That would be the thing"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Learned that my sister will wear her mask but thinks it's going to cause bacterial infections and won't get the vax because she has a heart condition"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Which to me sounds like a compelling reason not to get covid"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: I dunno. She's not a good logician. She's got a Not Gate at the end of her flow"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: \"Okay... everything looks good... and how the fuck did you get that conclusion?\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: https://youtu.be/g3U6IUMTDHY"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: I think what your sisters saying would be more like “penny wise, pound foolish” though? I wonder which fallacy that is"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Wtf"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: She's also pwPf. Insists on all organic shit. Drinks nothing but pop"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: The amount of formaldehyde in one can of pop is like 3x what's in roll insulation, and places will request formaldehyde free insulation because of its long term effects"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: The forbidden cotton candy"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Why do you have a folder called “Internet”?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Pwpf?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: What’s in the other folders??"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: This"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Cause I'm a Boomer at heart"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: The issue is about 30% is pretty interesting or funny"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: The rest is garbage"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: I had to wade through you all talking about retirement plans for your kids"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: I said something about Joe being Trisha this whole time"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Well Tristoe is currently behind so you're good unless they saw the popup"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: The main spot I'm getting mixed up is I don't remember what topics we haven't covered in the other chat"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Why? Crank up the white noise"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Yeah me neither, was the white noise convo in this one?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Nah it was there, but stuff like Krishnan having COVID wasn't"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: You should probably just put all callbacks in this chat"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: To avoid the cross contamination"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: White people more likely to be jailed than Hispanic people. Guess we needn’t worry so much about the border"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Where are the rest of the races?"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: You’re race fluid"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: It is kind of fun that I can pass as Mexican, Egyptian, or Indian (apparently)"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: But also awkward because people will start talking to me in languages I don’t understand"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Not to be confused with starting fluid"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Imagine being jonas and people write to him in English"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: People spoke Swedish to me in Stockholm. It’s jarring experience"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Lolll I was literally about to ask you if people talk to you in Swedish"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Slave"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: He’s gonna be a slave at the Wendy’s drive through without that retirement fund"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Interesting thing over time is that past war contributions have always been measured in casualties. How much did the US contribute to winning WW2? I dunno, how many soldiers died?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: And i think about that in the new era where we're more conscientious about each casualty"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: And this guy just threw out his security over 13 soldiers who died unnecessarily"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: You're the victim of social programming"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: That line of thinking re: Gardasil/any other vaccine is so annoying and I wish that the scientific community would spend more time explaining how trials work and how statistical analysis works."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Yeah but you're thinking rationally. These people are just dumb"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: You can't fix stupid"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Even though we're at hundreds of millions of doses (Gardasil) and billions of doses (covid)"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: We don't know the 50 year effects of the vaccine!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Right"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: I think there's truth to that. The mechanism shouldn't do any weird long term shit, but we don't have the data"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: But how? There's just no reason to even think that they might."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Ever write software?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: That's a reasonable reason to doubt actual gene therapy but it's not like any part of any actual vaccine remains in your body for any appreciate length of time relative to that time horizon"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: You write something and make sure it works for what you intended and test it against the cases you can imagine where it might go wrong... then during the entire product life cycle you discover the cases you missed"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Then as you find bugs, you weight them by probability of occurrence and severity"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Sure but how is that analogous to vaccines?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Any analogy fails on the specifics"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: They're tested for what they intend to do and what we can imagine they might do"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: But software on a computer does not operate in an analogous manner to vaccines within the body"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: As just one example, there's no mechanism of software analogous to the degradation and clearing of mRNA and/or spike protein from your body (in the case of the covid vaccines)"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: I think there's credence to the unknown long term effects... but i think most of the people who repeat it are just medically categorized assholes who are trying to make dismissive *gotcha* arguments like they saw Ben Shapiro or Steven Crowder make"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: I think there's actually a garbage collector that clears memory that no longer needs to be allocated, but my analogy is about the rigors of testing and things that still slip through. Don't get lost in the individual bits and bytes (you fucking lawyer)"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: But that's the point. You can't prove there's a realistic non-zero probability of long term effects of a vaccine using an analogy, let alone one that only holds on the generalities"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: What about what you've said is proof there can't be long term effects? Refuting my argument doesn't make yours right"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: mRNA vaccine should not result in DNA change. That's not how the mechanism works. I think they're 1. Worth the risk and 2. Potentially the breakthrough we need to eliminate lots of nasty diseases, amd for those reasons, i have already contributed to the automotive chip shortage, but i still assume I'm taking on risk"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I'm saying there's no scientific evidence there would be anything close to a widespread long term effect. Everything we know about vaccines generally says that we should already see at least some indication of adverse effects if they were going to show up. Your rebuttal just now is asking me to prove a negative, which I obviously can't do. I'm not saying it's impossible, just that there's no reason to believe there would be."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: And that there's lots of reasons to believe that there isn't"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Man i need to stay away from this chat while the 5-hour energy kicks in. I'll just argue to do it... like Schmitty"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I'm in class rn. I've got plenty of time. Lol"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Grandma is trying to piece together how i could be sick"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Man lawyers really do get a lot of leverage out of “reasonable”"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Didn’t we stop using the JJ vaccine because it causes blood clots? Biology is complicated, there’s always a reasonable amount of unknowns"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Software is a good analogy, and it’s far less complex than biology where everything just swims around in the same soup"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: But we also don’t stop using software because there *could* be bugs"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Using an appeal to authority argument, i now declare \"just take the L, bro\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: “Ok”"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: 🙌"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Do u think Roshan is an authority on vaccines"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I spent the first 6-8 months of James's life sick."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: On software development"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: My day is marked successful from having found a smug segue to \"just take the L, bro\". Thank you, gentlemen."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: \"☑️ Meets expectations\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: But this is in line with my point. The suggestion there may be a clotting issue was immediately apparent, within weeks of getting a dose and not 2+ yrs later."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: What if in 2 years it just coagulates your blood like gelatin? Low probability, high severity bug. Didn't think to test for that, eh?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: May have shared this before but"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: I've got about 3 hours left on being an argumentative cocksucker"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Maybe! But there’s a lot of reason to think it wouldn’t and it’s pure speculation that it might."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: I'll invest"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: What a wild story. I wonder what the rest of her life will be like"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Like I feel like a lot of people in her rough situation are much older so they just sort of deal with the rest of their lives for better or worse"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Tougher to get fucked in the ass in a women's prison"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: But she’s so young still"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: The lesson is to wait until you're older to start your rampage of white collar crime"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah. Like all things considered, Bernie Madoff’s life will probably wind up being better than Elizabeth Holmes’"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: But that’s not a great comparison since he also lasted much longer before being found out"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Oh god I was just reading how some people taking Ivermectin think they’re shitting out worms"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: But it’s actually their intestinal lining"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: I know some people for Texas that were posting on their Facebook how they were looking for some and if anybody had extra but they would take a bottle. At the same time they are posting all the time about how they won’t put anything like that vaccine in the body"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Got a Facebook Boomer blaming sleepy Joe for 9.11"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Best part is it's BDS, that Big Dick Swagger!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: lmao is that Uncle Bob?!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Yup"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Whose/who's uncle Bob?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: He’s Krishnan’s friends dad who happens to be a really famous programmer that goes by “Uncle Bob”"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: And a True Patriot"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: He apparently lost a lot of cache in the programming world by being outspokenly conservative (but like also about gay marriage and shit), and now has devolved into a Facebook Boomer who thinks Biden is to blame for 9/11"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Not his fault that people hate True Patriots"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Yeah someone made Twitter accounts called “goodunclebob” and “unclebobsbs” to filter out his Ayn Rand rants from his programming advice"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: He made me read the fountainhead and Atlas shrugged when I was like 10 years old. It didn't work on me clearly"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: His Rand tweets were bad but never 911 truther bad"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: I think what he was trying to get at was a future 9/11 would happen cause sleepy Joe let the Taliban win, even tho the Taliban didn't do 9/11"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Boy if anyone ever needed to stay in their lane a little more…"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Also Justin is 100% like him"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: DAMNIT"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: You win this time"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: What did I win?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: That work for you?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Haha. I was just trying to find where exactly this James Turrell piece is that's north of SF"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: And then I realized it's in someone's private collection on their private property"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Bummer"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Lol"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: But it also reminds me of how SF has some weird rich people"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Like this woman volunteers and then this guy is a psychiatrist at a government run hospital but somehow they own millions of dollars of modern art and she's on the board of SFMOMA"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: And they own a vineyard in Napa and a big home right in SF"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Easy to make money if you come from money"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah. That might be it or it could also be that they met all these artists when they were poorer in like the 50s-60s and got the art for cheap and now it’s worth millions and they’re just leveraging that"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: That’s what I was trying to find"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Apparently there's one on UIC's campus"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: At Roosevelt and Halsted"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: If you enjoy life and traveling I don't recommend having children"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Just got to Frankfurt. Slept 0 minutes"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Some of these German fuckers are tall"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: We're currently at a playground in the airport and it's hilarious there's 2 other kids here but they very much don't speak English but they're trying to talk to each other"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: How long til you get to Italy"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Flight is at 12:45 getting into Venice at 1400"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: So I think that's around 4 hours from now"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Same language. Your kids are presumably sober, so they haven't switched to German English yet"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: The other kids were polish so they sounded drunk"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: They're Polish so they might have just been drunk"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Careful, i assumed Joe was born with a bottle in his hands, and it turned out i gave him his first alcohol. That went poorly for me"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Happy Khalil Mack day"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Oh and I guess happy anniversary Krishnan"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: That's right baby 🐻🔙"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Are the Bears back??"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Once the ginger is benches"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: The o line needs to come back first"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Uncle Bob been going ham making memes on FB"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Holy fuck a 3 year old on 2 hours of sleep over 24 hours sucks real bad"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Just give him a light sleeper hold"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Forced nap time"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: That's all in 24 hrs!!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Throw him in the canals"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Didn't we pull out a day in advance because it was done?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Consistently good coloring though"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Bob is design minded in his memes"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Sink or swim, bitch"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Is the “we should have stayed” position a conservative thing now?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Parenting!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Uncle Bob is a dogshit designer, I’ve seen some of his other stuff and he definitely paid someone for this"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: The kerning and spacing is all correct, no way Bob did that"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Seems like it. They've been scrambling to bury all the evidence of praising trump for negotiating a peace with the taliban"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: You think he paid someone to make those garbage ass memes??"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: I fuckin hope so"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Even high school goal posts are sunk in the ground"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Meanwhile trump came out saying his plan was always to let Afghanistan rot, maybe even drop a few more bombs after leaving"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Max are you just powering through?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: https://t.co/4VIAS2FxWM"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Schmitty wasn't this your argument?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah. Well, I had said there was evidence that it wasn’t changing employment trends but it was early on in the cut so it was less conclusive than it appears to be now"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I think the answer is probably no but, Jonas, do you ever use either of the Teleflex EZ-IO or BD Intraosseous Vascular Access System as part of your practice?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: We use teleflex"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Oh cool. I wouldn't have thought that was something relevant for you. Didn't mean to exclude you. Have you ever used the BD one?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: For the Teleflex one, do you like the connection between needle assembly piece and the drill?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: We tend to not us IO access unless necessary for recussitstion in trauma"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: And that's by the ED/trauma docs"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: It's used in trauma and critical cade"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Never used BD. I think the connection is fine? But no basis for comparison"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Care*"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Schmitty, are you about to start moonlighting or are you deciding whether you're about to destroy one of these companies?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: It is for work. Was just curious what users might have thought about the two"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: That will be $50 for my professional opinion"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Lol. Now we're talking"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Also, just tried to get a reservation at The French Laundry and it was sold out in 10 seconds. Guess I gotta make friends with Newsom now if I want to go"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Don't you bill through insurance? ￼ you'll find out in several months what the charge is, and the bill will go to the wrong address"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Nah for consulting work. You just pay me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Cash is best"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Your opinion was trash tho. Mine is $100"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: We will let capitalism do the deciding"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: That blows tho. I wonder if there's a StubHub for resos"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: You're just gonna have to go to a 1 Michelin star restaurant like common trash"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Plebeian"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Looking that way. Already got a reservation to one earlier in the trip and there was no problem getting that. There are two other three star restaurants in SF that do rolling reservations so still got a shot at those in two weeks."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: I've heard really good things about lazy bear, I think it's a 2 star spot"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Could also always go get some Chipotle. 5 stars in my book."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I wonder how much of the demand is Covid related"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Revenge restauranting"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Lol. I just mean combo of pent up demand and limited seating"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: It’s as bad as his haircut"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: what does your wife think about your anniversary being Khalil Mack day??"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Used to dealing with my shit"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/20/us/abbott-covid-tests.html"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Cool"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: womp"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: That's mine!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Rogan got the Rona"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: I just saw that"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: He's taken all the good stuff"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: He took ivermectin, monoclonal antibodies, Z-pack antibiotics, and a vitamin drip for \"three days in a row.\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Guess which one worked the best..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Also is he vaccinated?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: I don’t think so"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Wait which one worked the best? I was going to guess vitamin drip"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Prolly the monoclonal ab"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: It's not very scientific"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Nope but it's better than dewormer"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: No i mean the fact that he threw everything at it is not very scientific"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah why wouldn’t the mab be scientific?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: It woulda be a big deal if he got real sick"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Perfect Winnie the Pooh meme"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: The Roshans of the world would get vaccinated"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: But I already got vaccinated"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah. No need to slag Roshan. Lmao"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: I did wait a good while to be fair"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: I was on the fence until shit picked up again"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Not what i meant. Just saying that we can't know what solved it because he threw everything at it"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: No I know that’s not what you meant. Jonas, the doctor, said “nope but”"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: My “yeah” was in agreement with your implication that you weren’t saying the antibody itself was not very scientific"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Oh. Jonas is illiterate"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Bone doctor"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: One funny artifact of this all is that this is a lot of peoples’ first exposure to monoclonal antibodies and so it’s becoming an eponym for specifically the antibodies used for Covid."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Like I saw a billboard advertising mabs for covid so I got curious and went and looked it up and the whole website just said the treatment was “monoclonal antibodies” and not which ones"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: As if just any antibodies would be good enough"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Netflix has eerily good timing with some of the documentaries they’ve been releasing"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Like their series Pandemic came out in January 2020"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: And now this 9/11 documentary series weeks after we pulled out of Afghanistan"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: 🤔🤔"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: The NWO is getting too cheeky."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: I do love how people are like \"you don't know what's in the vaccine!!\" And then end up taking gallons of shit like monoclonal Abs"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Also who is prescribing this shit? Steroids might worsen mortality for people who don't require oxygen at time of taking it"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I'm so poor I don't even know the difference between Michelin stars. But I'm rich enough to have owned a set of Michelin tires"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Wasn't his whole argument that his immune system was strong enough to handle it without the vaccine? But then he gets lab grown antibodies pumped directly into him?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: 😓"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: As it turns out, everything's cool until you get the rona"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Ain't no fun when rona's got the gun"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Apparently I would have sat next to Tiffany Haddish from Frankfurt to Venice had I not chosen the middle seat next to my entitled asshole 3 year old"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Yeahbut you don't know who that is"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: The perks of paying for business class?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: TODAY IS MY DAY OFF"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: I'm so excited."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: You earned it. 🍾🍾"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Never a bad idea to have a champagne Thursday."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: 19 days in a row. Never again please"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Damn dude. That’s crazy"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: How’d that happen?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Unlucky with call weekends. I made a switch with a partner because they couldn't take one. So I worked two weekends in a row."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: And because the is the Ortho academy meeting this week"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: I've been on call 6 of 7 days"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Ah. That was nice of you"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: But not today!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: This is who I get to hang with today"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: You should steal some of her hair"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Lol. Looks better on her"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Just remember your medical opinion is worth at most half of Krishnan's, so don't do anything that risks your hands"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Enjoy it and don't take her on any vacations you want to enjoy"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: So you're having fun in Venice?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Also Lufthansa business class in Europe is just the first 8 rows of a normal 737 style plane with nobody in the middle seat lol"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: LMAO"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: You got played"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: The picture of me carrying James is how most of the trip has been"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I mean 9.5 hours with lay flat seats covers the 1 hour European flight"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Your wife does a good job making it look like you guys are having a good time though"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: That's what social media is about"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Fair"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Is this all on Instagram? Maybe I should actually use Instagram"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Not telling everyone that a 3 year old has been whining for 2 days straight and that the baby screams for 4 hours intermittently on a plane because some dude sneezed 5 times as loud as he could"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: This is how air France was for Paris to Milan too. But way better for the cross Atlantic flight"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: https://youtu.be/MUINFs1Sp94"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: If it makes you feel better Max, I'm having a bitchin time"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Your vacations look very different. Max is in Venice in like historic Italy and you just fucked right off to the countryside"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I'm being overly critical, definitely getting better with the kids adjusting"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: I've done the historic shit in the past"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: And I'm in Florence now which is nice but mostly gonna be goin to wineries in Tuscany"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Once we're done with Chip's wedding we'll just relax in Monterosso for 5 days/4 nights"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: I'm going to this restaurant named cibreo tomorrow. The owner also owns an Asian Italian fusion restaurant and named it Cibleo"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Oh no"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: So they are both pronounced Cibreo?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: At least you know that it should be pretty good Italian food"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Also saw this dude today. Casual 6 Corona Thursday night solo dinner"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: The vibes are impeccable"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Then he scootered drunkenly off into the sunset"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Sounds like the life"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Also his mullet 🤌🏿"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: I wonder what he’s taking a picture of that could be more unusual"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: There must have been like a panda on a tricycle across the street"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: He was face timing someone"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I've officially switched from drinking water to Aperol Spritzes though since they're the same cost"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Now we’re talking"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Probably equally as hydrating too"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: More leg room? Free drinks?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Please be real"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Italian food with msg"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Nah. When it’s slightly overtly racist, it’s good Italian"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: It did have food and drinks too. Haddish ordered vodka on the rocks"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: So you were close to her, just not next to her"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: You could have talked to her about those movies you've never seen or even heard of"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I would've been the aisle to her window, so we were the same row still. She's got like shaved short blonde hair or some shit I didn't recognize her"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: We just saw a sign for her when we got off and I guess she posted it on social media somewhere"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I've also been on a plane with Yadier Molina back to St Louis but he was a huge douche bag unsurprisingly"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: That just sounds like a prima donna soccer player"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Ohh... a *catcher* 😉"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: What's happening in the news that's so bad? I'm just seeing a bunch of \"world is ending\" posts with no comment (not the first time)"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Or just typical sensitive snowflake shit"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: \"My feelings are hurt because a state I don't live in changed their rules\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: A Texas abortion ban didn’t get stayed by SCOTUS"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Ah so it was that"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Is my guess as to what is causing the posts."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Is it just lawyer shit to use negatives at every opportunity?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Lol. Well considering that what happened is that SCOTUS *didn’t* do something, the negative is appropriate"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I could have say “SCOTUS declined to stay the ban”"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: To use active tense"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: A not the 49 states that aren't Texas anti-life ban didn't get not unstayed by all the courts that aren't not SCOTUS"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: You have passed the bar"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Sure sure, but it's possible to form a sentence that states clearly what the results are"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: How so?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: You spent a bit on this"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: What would the sentence be?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I'm drunk enough on wine that it was worth it"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Also the kids are up"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Texas made abortion illegal and the SCOTUS ruled to let it pass."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: If i even understand all your damn negatives correctly"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: The latter part isn’t really correct though"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: They declined to review it"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Texas is just trying to get more electoral college votes"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: They didn’t positively make any determination"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: The deep state 20 year plan"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: So remove \"ruled to\" and walk away with a sentence that reads clearly"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Extrapolating from freakonomics, children who would have been aborted will probably vote Democrat"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Sure"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Touche"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: But let's not forget these are the same people interesting horse medicine"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: There, now i don't need to pay $600 per hour to read the news"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Ingesting*"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Haha"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Horse medicine types keep their kids"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: My point is Texas is a republican state"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: So they're the ones changing the rules not realizing abortion lowers crime rates"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Think of all the money you’re going to save"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Until 18 years pass and all those unaborted kids start voting"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Texas has a different outlook on that. They call it \"good guy with a gun\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: As much as \"good guy with a gun\" is basically trash, i believe there's credence to \"potential bad guy who's pretty sure everyone in the room is armed\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: I can finally afford to learn!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I do buy into that some. You'd fuck with less people if you knew they also had a gun"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Yeah it's more \"bad guy not going to knowingly pick a fair or even unfair fight\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: If you got mad at how I wrote that sentence, you’d be pissed to learn how some judges handle statutory interpretation"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: How much of my last 48 hours has been spent"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: That reminds me of \"deaf girl wants to do porn\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: There was this dog at my old apartment building who moaned like a human. It was weird"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: During sex?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Who was fucking this dog?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Hahahah"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: On another note from the 2 days I've been here, Italian food in Italy is underrated in how good it is"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: So glad you had this queued up"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I had to scroll through my photos for a minute but I don't have that many and the preview frame is so obvious as to what it is. The dog would do that for a while, like 30-40 min and then stop."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: It didn't bother me because you couldn't hear it with the door closed but it was good for a laugh if you went into the hall and it was going on"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: https://youtu.be/VtZ_PIsNO5s?t=110"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Hahaha"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Finally watched this but yeah pretty much"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Y'all ever shit so hard you time travel?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: 💯"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: This bowel prep is no joke. Four hours passed like nothing in a constant state of either shitting or expecting to shit again"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Oh...yeah... Bowel prep..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: You’re in Dante’s 5th butthole of hell"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: That's what I was talking about"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: And not just a Tuesday afternoon"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: I assumed you were used to your own regular dumps"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Sometimes they are even too much for me."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Underwear off, naked, bent over, fan on, sweating, shitting so hard you're getting an ab workout."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Wow! You should see a... different doctor... about that"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Lol. It was something I ate. Rando taco stand in a parking lot at when drunk"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Monday drunk, eh? How's Lucy?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Lol. The Tuesday was for dramatjcy effect. Joke hits harder"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Lucy is great"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I have never once gotten nude to shit"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: You're missing out"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: All men die, but not all men truly live"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I've pooped while nude but I was nude already for another reason"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Best sex ever"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Yeah it's different. The convenient nude vs the necessary nude"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: The fraternity house would get handed over between each group of students, since Kettering was rotational."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: There was a brief time where the house would have been handed over but official governance hadn't resumed where there were no rules"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Zero section"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: 😂"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: That's when we'd do shit like party on the roof and smoke cigarettes while shitting"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: And drop acid"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: The one that stuck out most was smoking while shitting. We weren't supposed to smoke in the residential hallways"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: https://twitter.com/6thgrade4ever/status/1433519577892327424"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Damn it. Stupid fucking preview."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: truf"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: The latter is far less wealthy though, by many orders of magnitude"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: He should have patented the number counter"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Thanks again Ronald"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: https://www.insider.com/oklahomas-emergency-rooms-are-clogged-with-people-overdosing-on-ivermectin-2021-9"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: let them suffer"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: It’s obviously a terrible situation but I find the lag between the contrarian debate about ivermectin and the mass adoption fascinating."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: It's delta"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: What do you mean by this"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Like that ivermectin use seems to be exploding now, only months after the contrarians started pushing it. To the point that it’s a long enough lag that some (obviously not all) have stopped advocating its use."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Bret Weinstein for example has essentially given up the point as far as I can tell."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: He hasn’t repudiated it, which, shame on him, but he isn’t promoting it anymore"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: People weren't desperate to find anything that works until delta started kicking down their doors"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: It also takes time for things to kind of disseminate into the real Oklahoma qanon crowd"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Would be interesting to see correlation data for delta and ivermectin searches/use/etc."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: You mean they’re not all just listening to three hour podcasts??"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: A whole state full of intellectually dishonest people????"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: It’s also interesting the difference between ivermectin and HCQ"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: In how they played/are playing out"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Hcq was proven bullshit real quick tho. Ivermectin had those small studies and fraudulent big studies that were positive"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Ivermectin can be bought at feed stores without a prescription"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah. I’m not saying it’s unexplainable. I just find the differences interesting"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: And a bunch of people promoting it as a vaccine alternative"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Hcq died well before vaccines came out"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Are synthetic antibiotics trending too?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Synthetic antibodies*"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Idk. But that’s an interesting question. Does that also line up with the rise of delta or just interest in ivermectin?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: https://www.npr.org/2021/09/01/1031053251/sackler-family-immunity-purdue-pharma-oxcyontin-opioid-epidemic"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: The judge went with the \"middle ground.\" Released all liability for opioid claims against the Sacklers but not their associates and not for non-opioid claims."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: In exchange they pay 4.3 billion of the 10 billion they acknowledged making from running Purdue"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: We should promote antibiotics"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Like this?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Oh no. That’s gotta be shopped, right?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Yes"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: The MAGA crowd has gone too far now"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: \"Biden sucks\"?"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Weird thing is is we stopped for a bathroom break two hours before that"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Did he have a UTI?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Perhaps he spilled something on it... like a quart of his own pee?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Good point, Carter. Maybe he was just trying to drink some of his grandson’s pee, for his health."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Lol. Didn't have a change???"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: He found a new font"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I wonder how many people he's successfully influenced"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: I really don't expect that the guy who has spent 74 years bragging about underperforming vs an index fund was going to do any better, but does anyone know if we actually did get everyone out who wanted out?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: I assumed we left a day before the deadline because it was done"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: But i reserve that the bit about \"wanting to leave\" is subjective and will be abused in any further arguments"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: The people commenting are mostly other Boomer Republicans so he's kinda preaching to the choir"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: I was just remembering the 2010 NFC championship game again and got sad."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Was that the Cutler injury game"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Or was that the Chris Conte game"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: No the Conte game was 2013"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Why do the bears just make me want to kill myself all the time"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Yeah. Cutler injured. Lost by 7 due to a pick 6. Packers only made into playoffs because we lost in week 17 by like 4 points. And then Packers win the SB."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: But Roshan and I accidentally snuck into an open bar at goose island so that was nice."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Did it make the pain go away"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: No... No it didn't"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: It made the hunger and sobriety go away though"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: It wasn't even that expensive."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: And I drank a lot of 312 before it got shitty"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Almost as important"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Wasn’t it free?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: I think the drinks were"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Sometimes me being an idiot really works out"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Getting a free open bar sounds smart, not dumb"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: He just walked upstairs at Goose Island. Found a table"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Then Bo and I just walked in. It was a private party."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: LOL"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Maybe they hired extras to make it look like they had more friends and just figured you were the extras"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: LeBron is in Italy"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Did y'all see him"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: No but I've seen other black people"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: He's the tall one"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Can't believe Chip is married. Seems like yesterday he spent a few hours asleep in a bathtub with a random girl from Kalamazoo"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: He sounded fun"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: RIP single Chip"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Initial spicy take: Cinque terre is overrated"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: So many fucking people here, first place I've been to that just feels overfilled with tourists. I can just speak English instead of super broken Italian and pointing"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Isn't Italian just pointing?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Yeah they actually all just speak sign language"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: He just wanted to know whether he could use the N word or not. 😉"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Hahaha. Didn’t even think of that but that seems like the only reasonable explanation"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: It’s going to be wild to see how the workforce/employment distribution changes in the next 2-3 decades."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Kinda quiet today on the chat"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Also welcome back Joe"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Lucy has an ear infection I think so life hasn't been fun"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Everybody was just busy honoring the sacrifices of organized labor that came before us"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: We also lost two guys to Italy"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: That sucks. Biology should do better at giving kids better initial immune systems"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: And Joe’s on IR"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Don’t they get their mothers immune system? So it’s Bo’s fault"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: For having weak ass ears"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: He’s on the 60 day IL"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Kinda my fault. She got white people ear wax."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I honestly have no idea if that’s good or bad"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: But assume bad"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: How does your ear wax affect propensity for infections?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Yeah. Asians have very thin dry wax that just flakes."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: I have wax do thick that it clogs my head phone speaker and 0 sound gets through"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: So thick"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah. My right ear gets fully occluded every few years"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: White people"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Gotta get it scraped/sucked/sprayed out"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: It was also happening when I used foam tips on my earbuds and wore them more"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: I got this ear wax remover that has a camera at the end so you can see inside your ear"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: It was really weird but kind of cool"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Now that I’ve got custom molds, I think the build up is less"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: It was like $15 on Amazon, probably safe if you’re not an idiot"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Haha. Yeah. What’s the worst that could happen? Just puncture an eardrum or two"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: At least with my ears it’s pretty hard to get to the ear drum on accident, you have to turn this weird corner"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Does everyone have the same ear canal path?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Oh yeah, I was just being facetious. I agree with you that it’s relatively easy to avoid if you’re being careful"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: It’s deeper in there than you realize and you (or I at least) usually experience pain before getting close to the drum"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: As far as I know they’re all slightly different but everyone has a first and second bend"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Jonas can correct me if I’m wrong"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Bone doctor"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Lol. Lame"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: You definitely learned about the ear"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: If you stab someone in the ear, would it go into their brain or is there bone that blocks it?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: yeah. There are 3 bones there."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Also there’s those little bones"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Lol"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Hahaha"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: I have a very rudimentary understanding of the ear."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: For a doctor that is"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: There’s also those like stone things, right?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: That's the inner ear."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: For balance and shit"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Right"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Those count as bones"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: 2 me"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Lol. Not bones."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: It's a cool system"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I’m going to take you to court and convince a judge that the stones are bones"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: If you have 2 hours I think you'd enjoy learning about them"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Is that two hours in podcast form, ￼ ?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: I bet you could find one"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Judges tend to be kind of dumb / too busy to pay close attending so I think I could pull it off"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: *attention"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: There’s some good tennis on ESPN if you’re looking for late night sports"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Watching bachelor in Paradise"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Nice. I watched this season of The Bachelorette with Sara but idk I could do it again"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: It got too emotionally manipulative"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: That's the whole point."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Which made it very off-putting and hard to watch"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Did you guys watch fboy island on HBO Max? That's quality entertainment"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Quit being a bitch"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: It's all garbage TV. But I like turning my brain off."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: nah. I’ll continue to be a bitch"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I’m fine with garbage tv but this didn’t click with me"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: We finally don't watch bachelor/bachelorette anymore and just bachelor in paradise"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: And big brother but this season of BB is so boring"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: James had a fuck ton of ear infections. The only reason he didn't get tubes is because it took the ENT doctor's office forever to get back to us with scheduling an appointment and then it was like \"hey he finally hasn't had an ear infection in 3 months!\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: And you guys call yourself the master race smh"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Everyone pay Roshan?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: King shit"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Jordan is 🐐"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Imagine if he hadn’t been as good. Definitely would have gone down as an all time sick"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: *dick"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Nah I haven’t asked, we can just square up at the end"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Just ordered a second bodet"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Bidet"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: For the same toilet? Lol"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: DOUBLE BIDETS"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: It’s not gay until you have 3"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Also now you can eat twice as much Raisin Bran"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Well we have one for our shared bathroom. And now I need one for my poop bathroom"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: DJ slash saxophonist sounds like a good combo"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Was he generally laying down sax lines over dance tracks? Or did he reserve it all for Mr. Saxobeat?"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Sweet"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Very pitbull heavy playlist. He really is Mr. Worldwide"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Wonder if it's too late to book him to come to America for my wedding"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Nice"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: ￼ did you also play Indian music on full volume from your phone or were you and Surbhi the only Indians that don't do this in Italy?"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I think I'm approaching €100 of straight up wasted money. Best examples are buying a 5 terre day pass for €32 and going to 1 town for 1 hour and Rachel buying sandals to wear on the beach around 1pm when SHE KNEW SHE DIDN'T WANT TO GO IN THE AFTERNOON"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Loool. But now she’s got beach sandals for later"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Presumably in addition to the pair she already packed"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Lmao"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: They collapse at the top rn anyway"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: The 37% rate is for 520 single, 620 married"}

In fact, I'm pretty close to 100% recovered and feeling better than ever actually. I'm just taking this time to do a total life reset and haven't been on any social media or paying attention to just about anything online (as evidenced by the fact that I haven't been involved in our Signal chat haha.)\n\nI look forward to sharing my whole story with you guys at your wedding though. It was one heck of a roller coast ride with tons of twists and turns and actually makes for a pretty crazy story.\n\nHow did everything go at your bachelor party? Did you all have a good time?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Great. Glad you're feeling better! Also glad to hear that you'll be able to make the wedding. Will it be all three of you (just trying to finalize numbers)? It was a very good weekend. Went for a long hike on Saturday and otherwise just sort of hung around and joked about. It was good to get away for a weekend - I hadn't been to the Adirondacks in almost two years."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: I like this"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: What if Joe's big new lease on life is just that he doesn't think hyperinflation is going to happen now?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Also, I would love it if Joe became a Christian hippie"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Joe: Unfortunately I can't talk Trista into bringing Summer with/coming, so it will just be me. \n\nI'm glad you had a great weekend out there. I've never actually been out that way but I hear it's absolutely gorgeous! I've also never been to Boston so I'm looking forward to seeing/exploring the area. Should be a good time."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: No worries. That's been the case for a lot of people. Our friend is coming but the spouse/partner is unable to make it. Jonas is coming without Bo or Lucy."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Thanks for letting me know."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah. It's a really good time of year to come for a first visit"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Dang it. Trista's not coming to the wedding. All of our most chaotic friends aren't going to make it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Guess Joe's just going to have the one kid then"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Omg. Lmao"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Btw that same VP was grilling us about project status today and asked \"okay. If i were a little Hitler, and i asked you why you are not done meaning you need to be done, what would you do to get it done\""}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Truly a masterpiece"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: My conscience says \"stop\" by it's totally disconnected from my phone"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Lol"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Depends if he gets the vaccine or not"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Man i cannot believe a dude just got VD, blamed it on the vaccine, and the world knows about it"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Which I'm certain is the real story, and she broke it off because he cheated and lied about it"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: I’m actually really curious what this life reset is about"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: I'm sure it starts with a zero-low media diet"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: But what instigated the reset? He found god already didn’t he? Did he just find god again?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: He nearly died from going down a 4-year hard- right rabbit hole and made owning libs his life's work"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Yeah but I kind of doubt he’s changed his conservative opinions"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: I’m rooting for the hippy Christian hypothesis"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: maybe he is going thrbmax approach. Hates liberals and liberal ideals but hates hard right more. So he's just angry"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: The Max*"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: I'm hoping for a more gentle, corrective conservative Joe. Not that he got to \"fuck your feelings\" levels of cocksucker, but just not so damn reactive and argumentative."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: That would suck, we wouldn’t have any wildcards left in the group"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: What do you guys think Kenny is up to these days?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: He's probably on the downward slope of a \"flowers for Algernon\" curve"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Also... same."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Unrelated: one of the unspoken nuisances of parenthood: picking up a thermometer and wondering \"has this been in a butthole?\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: We have a butt thermometer and we don't know which one it is anymore 😂"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Exactly! Your options are 1. suck it up, clean it, and take your chances or 2. Stuff it up your own butt"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: So i just won't know whether I'm running a fever, i guess."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Either of those options are fine."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: On second thought, it’s kind of a wild card thing to have a life reset so I’m hopeful the group dynamic won’t change much"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Just by not being on social media he's already more down my path of righteousness"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: You should start a cult"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Simple no"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: They actually are that high"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: More or less we have increased spending on administration which hasn't helped with patient outcomes"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Turning medicine into a business."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: My idiot fat sister is not entitled to the same quality of care"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: What are you calling higher quality care though?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: He got multiple quotes for surgery. One guy wanted to put a cage on his neck. This guy did something much less dramatic"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: The life sustaining care shouldn't be differentiated by your ability to pay. That's the floor. If you want more puddin while you stay in your suite for 3 days for an ingrown toenail removal, you should pay extra"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: So we get rid of health insurance and health insurance companies, cut out the middle man"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: That decreases cost"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Except government agencies are notoriously inefficient, so trusting them with healthcare is frightening"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Our current system is just as inefficient and has the side effect of leaving people broke"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: I had an insurance company tell me I couldn't treat a patient at my hospital so they needed to be transfered to this other specific hospital in the area."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: That hospital doesn't even have ortho"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Let alone peds ortho"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: So I had to get on the phone for 30 min along with another physician at that hospital to say why this patient can't be transfy"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Transfered"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: I had an insurance company tell me I couldn't work up a patient for lung transplant, after his insurance also turned him down at the other two centers in Chicago"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: And this was in the middle of a busy clinic where I was seeing 40 patients that day"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: It is kind of crazy that a huge part of a career decision can very well be health insurance related"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Like \"I hate what I'm doing but I have to so I can afford healthcare for my family\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Basically every insurance company. It's cheaper than a lung transplant for sure"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: much cheaper"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Some of the frames I put on, the company charges around 10 grand"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Medicare is actually really efficient. Only like 3-4% goes to admin"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: No matter what we do, the very least we should do is decouple insurance from employment. It’s only the way it is because of the tax incentives that were given to employers for offering insurance."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: In total or at the government side? I do not believe this"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Like total cost of running Medicare"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: 3-4% of it is admin."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: But you have to do apples to apples. Same calculation yields 20%+ for private insurance"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: I really don't believe that accounts for the hoops the provider goes through to get paid by Medicare"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: But they do that for regular insurance too"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: You have to fit your care to what Medicare will reimburse"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: And you don’t for private insurance?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: True, but i doubt that's encompassed by a 3-4% figure"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Even 20%"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Krishnan and Jonas just told stories of having to tailor care"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Right but the point is that from the government expenditure side, Medicare is really efficient"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: And much more efficient than private insurance"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Oh I’m sorry. Medicare is actually 2%"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: The government is a huge pit of waste and inefficiency for the most part but they really cracked the code on Medicare somehow"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: I've already said i want that sweet govt insurance for basic care with the option to pay more for elective care. We don't disagree. My point is that there's no fucking way this figure accounts for total cost to consumers, and i believe it's only factoring the administrative side for the government, not the care provider"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: I sincerely apologize for the run on sentence. I'm better than that."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Oh yeah. Sorry. I wasn’t trying to be argumentative. I was really surprised when I found out the number myself"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I think the Medicare For All proposal is stupid but would support simply removing the age requirement for existing Medicare"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: I recently learned that medicare gets really authoritative around your retirement years though, and I'm not happy about it"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I also agree with you that it’s not all encompassing but the point is to compare to the existing system where it comes out ahead but like an order of magnitude"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: What does this mean?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Premiums jack up really high if your income is over like 40k, which hasn't been adjusted since 40k was a decent amount of money"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Make 41k? Premiums are $600/ month"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Want to get private insurance instead of paying the $600/ month? That's illegal. You can only buy supplements to Medicare"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Interesting. That does seem too low to kick in / could probably be more progressive"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Want to wait to sign up after 65? Premiums go up 10% per year"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Oh interesting. I didn’t know this part"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: My MIL is wading through this shit having never earned w2 income here. It's a mess"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: What is the regulatory overhead? Do they have to be licensed?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah. Majorly"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Nope that's all correct. 4:1 in infant room. I think 8:1 for James's age"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: ￼ do you feel like there’s any general correlation between “quality” and price or is it sort of arbitrary? / was quality or convenience more of a determining factor when you chose?"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: So now we're switching to one less convenient but not the most fucking expensive daycare in the area run by someone who's never owned a daycare before"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Are they generally one offs or like local “chains”?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: mine is a chain"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Seems like even raking parents over the coals can’t be that lucrative if there’s like 20 kids in one spot"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Our cost for 2 kids was 2400. New one will be somewhere around 3300. The \"primrose\" takeover cost would be 4100"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: And this specific one is associated with USC so it's close and we get a discount"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Same. We're switching to Kindercare"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: We play around 2200 for Lucy"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Primrose is also a franchise"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: In the infant room, it doesn't make business sense to pay more than $14/ hour with the 4:1 limit"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah. It’s just weird economics"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Where is the money going?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Other than rent/compliance"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: At 4:1 and a rate parents can stomach, a single teacher can book ~$1200/week. As a lawyer, you book that in 2-6 hours?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah but like if the teachers don’t own it, they’re making <$600/wk. And it would be less than 2hrs of my time for what I would bill for my time, 10hrs in terms of my take home."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: No question where the extra money that I bill out goes though. 😢"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: According to \"Suits\" you really want to get on contingency and bully corporations into taking your deal"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: But my point is that a $1200/week booking doesn't leave tons of room for employee pay"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I think it’s fair to say they shouldn’t get the “full” tax benefit"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: It's an interesting cutoff for analysis, for sure. What if i got to 19 million through extreme growth? Don't you actually expect to have millions in your retirement account?  Perhaps 5-10?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: This is why I've always been hesitant to put too much into a Roth. I knew some libtard would decide to tax that money too"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: There are pretty few limitations on what you can invest in with a Roth. It’s just a question of getting one set up that will work with you to do what you want"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: But they’re not going to tax it more than any other account"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I think that's a reasonable expectation for our generation"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Well, like 10 of us"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: But the money has already been taxed"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Uhhh"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: You have in a brokerage account"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: By the time we retire 40 years from now 1 mil will be like 5 mil just from inflation"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Just from Biden's presidency"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: The point of the miniscule contribution limit was to limit how much money went untaxed later. You're talking about changing the rules to the game on account of finding out someone won"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: *4 years"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Sure. So what?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: But it begs the question how one could game the growth"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I think the rule for IRAs is just that what you can invest in has to be generally available to the public but other than that can be anything"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Could you create a company to invest in then use another company to keep sending it revenue then sell it off?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: The ProPublica report raised some question of whether Thiel’s “founder shares” for PayPal met the criteria or not"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Pick stocks that don't suck"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: IRA contributions when you have access to a 401(k)/403(b) are also after tax money"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Not traditional. My 401k is pre tax money"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Well up to the income limit"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I should have been more specific"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Well duh. I'm not some mega rich idiot putting after tax dollars into a pre tax retirement account"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: We already discussed it"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: 👨‍⚖️"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Oops. 🤷🏽‍♂️"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: The takeaway was to switch to roth everything because taxes will only ever go up"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Let's talk about it again. I'll take a different view point"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Dems are the best we should just tax everything more"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: If we tax 100%, you'll be provided for 100%"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Like a sex slave?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Fine. Here’s another one from today. Buying the dip as an investment strategy is much worse than dollar cost averaging: https://t.co/DeWUQO48BD"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I was honestly a little surprised"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: That's because you're a dip"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: At least by the magnitude of the difference"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Maybe but a dip who only dollar cost averages"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: DCA is definitely the way to go. Don't get cute. Don't try to time. My best performing account is my 401k because it gets money every 2 weeks and I invest it"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: This is why i like my 401k stacked. It's the control to my experiment and it's much better funded"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I sold some positions and am at 18% cash in my personal account trying to figure out what to do with it while the rest of my positions went up 10%"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Max has all the cash on the sidelines we keep hearing about"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Might I recommend some deep OTM extra levered put options?"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Smart"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Smart"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: They were deep ITM calls on SNOW. Sold around 300. Would've expired in the 320s, so only missed out on ~$2500 per call"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Exactly"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: It was Bay area until COVID"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: So idk"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I looked at the patent application they have"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: It kind of sucks"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Like I would enjoy trying to invalidate it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Technically that color already existed so they can only patent it as a method for creating some random polymer"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: That’s my stab at it"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Lol. Nah. They can definitely patent the actual composition of particles suspended in a matrix that is causing it to be white but the way they're trying to do that is a little rough"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: http://www.nooooooooooooooo.com/"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: That’s what I get for doing it myself"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Our wedding planner encouraged us to do everything ourselves"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Just saw a tiktok/reel telling people to stop drinking so much water because it can poison you"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Lmao"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah. We never got a planner. I just knew I’d want to have too much of a say in decisions to justify paying someone to do it"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: You’re forgetting the core tenant of doing research - whatever information you happen to find, from whatever source, and choose to believe is the truth"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Drink when your thirsty seems to work well too. Whatever the optimum is, there’s clearly a wider range of acceptability than anyone with strong “amount of water drinking” opinions will admit"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: You’re probably right"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Still a bit different tenor than last time coin talk got big"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I’m pro-coin and I also hope someone accidentally sticks it in a vending machine"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: What is pro-coin?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Pelosi talking about doing something and not following through? Unheard of"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I want them to mint the trillion dollar platinum coin"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: In a sense, i find it pointless. It devalues the currency, but damn if our reps haven't done that much worse already in the last 2 years"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: It actually does not devalue the currency"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: It merely swaps one asset for another"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Go to appropriation jail!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: No new money is made"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Pardon?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: The coin is exchanged for existing bonds on the fed balance sheet at a 1:1 ratio. No money is created or destroyed in the process."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: You have a trillion dollars (worth of bonds) before and a trillion dollars (worth of coin) after"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Biden will mistake the coin for a hard candy and eat it by accient"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Accident*"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: That will definitely destroy some money"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: OR SMART ENOUGH"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: #Theydidtheirownresearch"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: The treasury would mint a platinum coin worth whatever it says it’s worth (generally people talk about it as a trillion dollar coin) and exchange it for treasury bonds that are maturing"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Like the part where they talk about his big ass TV and it looks to be like a 50 inch CRT"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Lol yeah"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: But still pretty solid movie. Shout out to Donald Sutherland for not aging at all in the past 18 years since that movie came out"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: For real"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Sexist"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Inception"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Watching it now"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: How is it so far"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: It's not the books"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: I feel like it can't be the books"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: But enjoying it"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: It would be a boring show"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: The whole story of the books is \"oh no it's all gonna fall apart, jk it didn't\" on repeat, would make for kinda dumb tv"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: I can’t imagine how they could match the books, there’s so much detail"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: And yet nothing happens"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Yeah it’s really abstract"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Like they're good books but just wouldn't translate at all"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: I have multiple hard copies of the book"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Love them"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Also I'll maintain that the I robot movie was good if you turn your brain off"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Liking it"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Dude. The shortage is real."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Due to illegals?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Bo"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: No"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Due to hospitals not paying enough to keep staff"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Maybe they can convert some of those adminstrative staff"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: If only"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: And stop charging me $200+ for a COVID test for an infant"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: It's both right? Unvaxxed Rona patients have been eating ICU space, but also everyone in healthcare is burnt out and under paid and RNs are a major shortage"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: That's random testing sites that are predatory"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Not a problem in civilized counties"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: That's urgent care being fucking useless and expensive"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Fuck urgent cares"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Staffed by NPs and PAs that don't know enough"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I thought nurses got paid decently but I understand not wanting to deal with COVID"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: They do. But when you've been taking extra shifts and exposing yourself to a dangerous disease and seeing people die at a higher rate."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: And then admin throws a pizza party"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: To say good job"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Kinda doesn't really fly"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Do they really throw pizza parties?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: YES"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: it's fucking ridiculous"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Our clinic manager"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: That's the shit we do in corporate America"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: To promote wellness"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Oh no it's worse than I thought"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: After all of the ideas and complaints about wellness"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Love wellness"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Bought a fucking massage chair"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Instead of actually changing things"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Blood flow is good for wellness"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: I'd kill for a massage chair tbh"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: The worst is they always buy shitty pizza too. At least hook it up"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: when I'm on call for the weekend I buy the entire OR good pizza"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: See you're part of the problem"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Throwing fucking pizza parties"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: not a pizza party"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: It's like if your coworker bought pizza for everyone"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Much better"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Last time I was on service I was gonna buy pizza for everyone but then I got covid before the weekend"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: My boss is technically a coworker"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: I just give my credit card to the charge nurse and say buy whatever"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: I hope she buys herself something nice, like a new laptop or something"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Technically that's whatever"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: So if we have more nurses can we kill more people faster"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Or people are just burnt out and nobody wants to be a nurse anymore"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Yep"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: And they are leaving for better paying traveler jobs."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: And hospitals are paying travelers more than nurses that have been there for a long time. And that pisses peeps off"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Travelers are just people who hop around?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Yeah. Usually through an agency"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: And signed on for short term contracts."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Holy shit you guys really are corporate America. Let me guess, and then you just keep resigning those contracts"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Same travelers"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: So a \"short term\" contract ends up lasting years for someone"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Maybe they take 3 months off. But they come back"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Yep"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: It's the one way to make really good money as an engineer. As long as you have a spouse that can cover the benefits"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Too bad your wife is too busy getting pregnant every ten seconds"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I wish. It's very much once every two years"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: And now nurses are getting fired/ resigning rather than taking the shot"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Yeah but this extra shifts paid!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Projector"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Sara’s hospital is short staffed at night. They’re currently paying nocturnists $2700+ a shift just to entice people so a lot of senior residents are moonlighting shifts."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Why don’t you pose that question again in the other chat"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: I was just thinking that, I wish this conversation was in there"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: In addition to financial and military aid, the United States also provides large-scale political support to Israel, having used its United Nations Security Council veto power 42 times against resolutions condemning Israel, out of a total 83 times in which its veto has ever been used. Between 1991 and 2011, out of the 24 vetos invoked by the United States, 15 were used to protect Israel.[4][5]"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: That thought was pretty jumpy... guess these edibles are finally kicking in, amigos"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: I barely saw anyone at my wedding. I also got hammered"}

Yakub died at the age of 152, but his followers carried on his work. After 600 years of this deliberate eugenics, the white race was created.[7] The brutal conditions of their creation determined the evil nature of the new race: \"by lying to the black mother of the baby, this lie was born into the very nature of the white baby; and, murder for the black people was also born in them—or made by nature a liar and murderer\".[4]"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Why tie the game when you can try to lose"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Welp"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Should be second and 15 and roughing the passer"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Get him out of the pocket what the fuck"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Nagys playcalling is just so stale now"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Imagine that"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: GODDAMMIT"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: 1Job"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: This offensive line is so bad"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: So bad it's.... offensive?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: stop it"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: No. That's the defensive line's job"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: First one was bad. Second effort was good."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I feel bad for our defense. Making big plays when they need to only to get sent back out"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I think we just put in Tay Zonday at o line with the bad back and all"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Can't be fucking worse"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Peoples Jones just mossed Kindle vildor"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Good play"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: We need more Roquans"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: And Bears o line from 2006"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Hunt and Chubb are goood"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Olin kreutz would probably start for this team right now"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Fuck"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: honestly being down by 7 is the best would could hope for"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: We deserve worse"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Maybe light a fire under Nagy's stupid ass"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: What is the role of the offensive coaching staff here?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Like what does bill Lazor do"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Nagy is too busy calling pitches on 3rd and 1 to listen to anything he says from the booth"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Yeah whoever is calling the plays needs to fucking go"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: I remember that play to Olsen"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: 224 to 42"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Fucking embarrassing"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: ugh. Prater just missed a 68 yard FG and they ran it back"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Meaning they aren't ever gonna try again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: This is why you don't kick 68 yard Field goals"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: unless you're in Denver and it's 80+"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: I just don't understand nagy. Why is he trying to just keep fields in the pocket when your oline been getting whipped up and down the fields? Kid runs a 4.4 use his fucking strengths"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Like I don't think I know more about football than Matt nagy. But do I?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I'd vote for you over him in the recall"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I might just start chugging bourbon"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Smart"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Well half time was great"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Glad we made zero adjustments"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: I don't think he's holding it too long"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Ifedi bad"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Everyone deserves a lil rest"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Wtf was Johnson doing"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Over ran"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: A little opi"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Quinn really good at pressure, really bad at tackling"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: 😭"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Lol Orlovsky just said this feels purposeful what Nagy is doing"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I'm a Browns TD away from getting out fall decor"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Setting up fields to fail"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: It does!! Like how does he not make a single adjustment?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Me thinking about the fields rookie of the year bet I made earlier this week"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: quinn good"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: He still needed help on the tackle lol"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Yeah idk what Desai is seeing in him that Pagano couldn't, but he's been good this season"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Brown power"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: HE DOESN'T EVEN HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO THROW A FUCKING SCREEN PASS"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I wish this game was in Chicago"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Wheels are falling off right now"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: The crowd should be booing"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Ugh"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: WOW ARob"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: I do love the crowd reaction shots. So Ohio lookin"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Skrong"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: How the fuck is that not roughing"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Late hit??"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Shoulda thrown tho"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Oh the defender put his hand up to show he didn't mean to"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Life is yard"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Follow that up with a weak holding call"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Pain"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: SHOW ME DPI"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Arm punt?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Let's go!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Dpi!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: That's weaaaak"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Lol"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Soft as fuck"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: But... I'm okay with it"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: best play of the day"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Fields missed Mooney"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: 7 sacks"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Yup"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Are we just not blocking the left side today?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Well they have Myles Garret which is an issue"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: And Peters is basically an open doorway"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Gone Fishin’"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: That occasionally gets called for holding without impeding the defender"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Bound to happen"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Keep running down our throat"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Two missed tackles tho"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Recoevers getting no separation"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Yep"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: No time"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: 3 step slant is as much time as he gets in the pocket"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Their kicker good"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Former illini"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: whose side are you on"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Dude put a TE in place of Peters"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Literally cannot do worse"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: What a dumpster fire"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Tonga tackles like Carter catches"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: don't throw it to stone hands."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: I'm sad"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: 1 loss closer to no more Nagy"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Tucker just beat the lions"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: 66 yard FG"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: This was basically the worst possible way to get Fields starts"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: I think we gave him acute depression"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Fucking Nagy"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Also someone on the Bears subreddit said this was in the top 10 worst offensive performances in the NFL of all time"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: I think just by total yards"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Studies show he actually only was the water boy for the Chiefs"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: we had more yards on the one PI call than the entire offensive game"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: “I’m not an idiot” —Matt Nagy, 2018-2021"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Jesus fuckin christ"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: The microchips are in the virus too? What was the point of getting the vaccine then"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Hey man, I don’t know. The microchips are everywhere. Watch out"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: A ~3x difference in death toll is pretty stark though"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Kinda like the suicide rate increase for teenagers from 2007 to 2017. Thanks Zuck!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Sorry, just kids 10-14*. Not all teenagers, but I wouldn't be surprised if those also went up significantly"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Inflection point was the 2006 bears losing the super bowl"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Lovie!!!!!"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Lmao"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: To be fair he didn't say anything about Foles until asked directly and then said \"sure\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: but it's bad"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Also watching some clips Fielda defs did not have a great day. Gotta get the ball out"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: can you imagine getting 9 sacks and like 1 second to throw in your debut NFL game?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Yeah that's rough. Some on him tho. Had receivers open and didn't find."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Yeah when you're running for your life every other play you stop seeing the field and start seeing ghosts instead"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Bad all around"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Are you gonna be surprised if we get smoked by the Lions? Cause I'm not"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: The comments on there are priceless. I support starting Foles this week, let someone else get crushed"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: There was never a play where it was like \"damnit Fields you had that much time and fucked it up\" or \"you had a guy wide open and missed\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: He missed a couple guys but I remember he already looked terrified by that point"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: The game plan was so fucking stupid the whole time"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: He actually looked pretty calm in the other ones but this ones funny"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: He didn't have enough time to panic"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: It's like they were spawn camping. He got the snap and it was instant \"ugh I'm dead\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: That was Jason Peters the whole day"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Imagine being a professional tackle and not trying to cover the guy on the edge"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Did you guys see Myles Garret's quote?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: https://twitter.com/jasonlieser/status/1442485479203540992?s=21"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: The dude was fishing four weeks ago"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: It's not even his fault really. Nagy put him on an island against a dpoy favorite and didn't give him any help"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Like does he not see Khalil mack get doubled or chipped every single snap and think \"hey should we try that\" after sack number 4?"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: guy is borderline in the ICU... Questionable for next week"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Just had an hour and a half class discussion about a case where the only question was whether a police officer acted \"reasonable\" or not during a car chase. Good time flexing the legal muscles."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: How do you not run into “depends on how you define reasonable” problems all the time?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Wittgenstein would have been an annoying lawyer"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: You tend to. Generally that's the role of the jury though to debate and make a decision about. Then you build up a body of cases with similar facts and the attorneys can draw analogies and distinctions between them to defend their positions."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: That's most of a what a legal brief is. A summary of what happened and then as many cases as you can find that are similar to yours that you cite to because they came to the same or similar conclusions and then you cite to ones that did the opposite and draw factual distinctions to highlight why the court shouldn't adopt the holdings of those cases."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Alexander Hamilton didn't have cases to compare to 😤"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: HAHA"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: He's the og. Wrote the Federalist Papers from scratch"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: No precedent"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Did we adopt any of the common law cases from England or just begin with 0 precedent?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: We adopted a lot of common law from England"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Got a giggle out of this one"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Even today every once in a while courts will delve into what the history of something was as part of their analysis"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Like they'll cite to cases in the 1600's in England"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Different implants"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: twas annoying"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: You guys should set up one of those little fly trap bags in the corner of your OR so it doesn’t happen again"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Fly strips. They give patients confidence that they're being handled with the utmost care and hygiene"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: I thought you said you take an MCL over ACL"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: As in you'd rather have that one"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: We’re buds"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Which is wrong"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Oh no. I was just using random betting term"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Plus different ligament"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: He also said that Horn tore his achilles when he really broke his foot"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: What’s the test?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Lachman. Just a physical exam that's very good test."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Basically tests the stability of the knee with the ACL on tension."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: If unstable probably means torn"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: So when you hear \"TEAM fears that PLAYER has torn ACL, awaiting confirmation with MRI.\" Usually means they had an unstsble Lachman"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Damn, this might be our last win until… the next time we play the Lions"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Who's ACL is torn?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Monty..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Possibly David Montgomery"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Good win. Fields looked good, some mistakes and held the ball too long, but some absolute fuckin moonshot balls"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Straight up mooneyshots"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Feels weird to say it, but he needs Mitch’s pocket awareness and check down accuracy"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Maybe a little more enthusiasm for titties if he ever wants to be NVP"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Mitch scored more TDs than Fields today"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: But did he do this?"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Such a good throw"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: His deep ball accuracy is so good, and he does it consistently"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: All we need to do is keep Nagy’s headset off every Sunday. Maybe he won’t notice"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Might take him a few games to realize it's not the plays he's calling"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Did you know diversity is an iceberg?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Lolol"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I'm going to be so trained on global power of diversity"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: I mean it's good"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Ask Surbhi"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Roshan's black friend?"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Thank you forclau"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Mule dyed her hair?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Hahaha"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I made 450 cookies today"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: So what? You want a cookie?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I’ve had a couple throughout the day"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Man i would have eaten like 10%. It's a good thing i don't bake"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: They’re for favors for the wedding so if I had eaten more I just would have had to make more"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: I assumed you didn't just make 450 cookies for yourself"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: You don’t know how I live"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Maybe I’ve become cookietarian"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I'm into saving money and making less trips to my in laws more"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Not sure what that means. As in they don't like her brunette?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: As in she only gets her hair done in Huntington and now she won't have to get it died every 6 weeks"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: That seems expensive"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Well she's gone to this lady since high school and she's cheap by comparison. She tried in San Diego a couple times and it cost $300"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Just did my hair for free"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Yeah and you look like you're a member of the proud boys"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: But it's free"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: And beats the alternative where I look like an old man"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Fair"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Yeah me too"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: This one was already sent"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Nope this is a third one"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: How come women can't dye their own hair a solid color?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: There's no extra shit going on in there."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Life’s about trade offs"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Bitches be shopping"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Pats kicker just doinked it for the L"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Well I guess we can finally call Brady good now that he's beaten every NFL team"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: That's a hard kick in the rain."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: I just sneezed and shot diarrhea out my ass"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Luckily already on toilet"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: pretty much"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Nobody told me sphincter control faded this hard when you turn 30"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: If you stop taking it up the ass it might stay tighter"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: But like Schmitty said, trade offs"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Speaking of which, did Rodgers change his pronouns?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Can't believe there was the exact gif"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Man, when is signal going to take inline formatting?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: How dead is FB right now? Dead dead or minor glitch dead"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Explains why whatsapp shit the bed"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: As much as i like whatsapp, if all of Facebook was erased from existence, it would be a good thing."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: There's a bunch of Instagram thots in mourning tho"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: They're just going to have to take the plunge and get an OnlyFans"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Ha i did just get the notification that Cody Cameron joined signal"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Apparently all of their internal tools are down and employees can’t email/message each other or get into buildings"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Definitely not a minor glitch"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: The root cause sounds like some boring network glitch, kind of like when your router stops working but for your entire global workforce"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: They should take out the Facebook cartridge and blow in it"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Bo's brother works for FB"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Is Bo's brother trapped *inside* facebook?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Lol he works remotely"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Phew"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: We're like one switch is Heusenstam from going down too. All the IT guys are contractors who don't have any skin in the game, so it's up to Jim in Grand Rapids to teach a non IT guy in Germany to keep it running"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Real hacker would have picked “0”"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Or 80085"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Lol"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: 69"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Not enough room for expansion. 42069 for sure"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Then you're guaranteed all the way up to at least 65535 before you have to roll over"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Is this a threat? That's assault. Do you want to go back to prison?"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: In my stupid league that won't get rid of kickers, we have a stupid rule where the highest scoring team wins $10 for the week. This will be my third week in a row of being the second highest scoring team (lost one of those games too). Vizcaino is my kicker."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: If he kicks and makes that field goal I'm the highest score."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: I recall this being considered shitty with sexy rexy"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Montgomery out some time. Not season ending though"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Williams gets first crack"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Glad we picked him up. He's a decent back"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: I think so too. He's been solid, blocking running and catching the ball"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: I do kinda wanna see what Herbert has"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Should just go to 4+ WR sets"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: 4 Verts"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Does everyone else feel like shit/get sick after a flu shot or is that just me and my family"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Should be coming back but he's a gimmick play guy can't be used like Monty"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Lol just you. Bo got double vaxed yesterday and feels ok so far."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: I more meant for being our punt return guy"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Same arm??? Idiot"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Lol yeah she apparently rolled up for the shots and was planning to do both arms but before she knew it the lady already had done both in her left arm"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Next you're going to tell me it spread to the rest of her body"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: She did have palpable lymphadenopathy in her arm pits"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Question. Nagy gives up play calling. Focuses more on being a head coach. Bears go...9-8, 8-9, 7-10. Somewhere around there. Bears look ok to good with only one more bad loss. Does Nagy stay?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Yes because management wants us to suffer"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: If we get to the playoffs, that’d be 3 of his 4 seasons"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: I think he is safe if we make playoffs or barely miss as long as we look ok and not like the Browns game."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Alright Nagy, just stop calling plays and avoid another top 10 worst offensive performance"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: I had us 2-2 or 1-3 at this point in the season so we are right on track."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: If we can sweep lions, split vikings and Packers we should be in ok shape."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Seems the chat has officially reverted back to sports"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: The key to this is less do the bears look good and more does Justin look good. If he does and it looks like a good partnership, I think he lives to fight another day"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: If Fields looks more like browns game fields and less Lions game fields, then nagy and pace are both on their ass"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: GI bleeders are probably a top 5 most common ICU diagnosis"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Is there a specialization for the taint? That’s what I expected"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Boom"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: It is weird that they're doing that though"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Lol"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I'm just a little surprised the terms are favorable enough that it's worth doing"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: That's what my father in law did to finance Rachel's education"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: A stretch from this topic, but I saw an article about some boomer who took out like $250k to put his kids through college and how he can't get ahead of the payments"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Made me think of the \"now imagine that child was white\" closing remarks from \"a time to kill\""}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Boomers have been shitting on us for years about student debt, now one of them gets fucked and they're like \"this would never happen to anyone!\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: *should never"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: So his millions make hundreds of thousands to millions while her 50 grand accrued 5% interest that we're paying back"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Probably lower than 5% over the last 2 years since I've looked"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: This is very confusing to me for some reason"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: So I don't know the exact details, I'll have to ask him sometime, but he had to pledge either certain assets or a portion of his portfolio"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah. That part I understand"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Like he doesn't get those shares back until the loan is paid off, but if they were shares of AAPL for example, you're destroying interest rates"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Right"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I think the initial pledge amount only has to be the size of the loan. Like I probably could pull out a loan from my investing account and use that cash for whatever. You only get screwed if your investments tank"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: You should make a $1M coin and sell it"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Flag tho"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: It’s gonna be that punch, on Edwards"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Dumb"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Cmon guys."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Why is our team so hood, stop punching people"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Although tbf the Raiders are playing a little dirty today"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: FUCK"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Noooo"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: That wasn't great"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Not good"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: That's how your tear an ACL. But hopefully just hyperextend"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: But he walked off on own power quickly"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: 🙌"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: He is goddamn tough"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Take this series off tho"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Maxx Crosby just choke slammed Justin after the play"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Fuck the raiders dude"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Herbert looks good too"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Both RBs do."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: As much as I love Monty we can't pay him when hes up for a contract"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Nice fucking play"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: That was a clean spin move"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: That's how you spin move"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Take notes Justin"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Ate 8 minutes on that play"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: And the note should be \"stop trying to do this\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: But if you do… do it like that"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Terrible stadium. Keeps hurting us"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Can't believe he dropped thst"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Better to be lucky than good"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Derek Carr is having a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: ARob has to catch those"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: This dude getting on the plane with a whole ass pizza"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Respect"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Is our defense 2018 good?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Front 7 is so stacked"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: No but I think it's probably the second best of the nagy era"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Gotta score more. Secondary also not as good"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Desai is such an upgrade from pagano"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: We made it ￼"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: We play Fangio style again minus the insane amount of turnovers though"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Yeah. Getting pressure without losing contain"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: A little more blitzing I think"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Fuck I really wanted a good drive there"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Quan just decapitated carr"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: That's tough hit"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: You should tell Joe"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Good challenge"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Frank: Southwest is fucked today"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Frank: flight just cancelled 😞"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Tough to overturn tho"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Fair"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Yup"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Ok so I'm connected to WiFi and apparently can still get signal. Can't stream tho. I'll take a play by play when good or bad things happen"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: First and 10, 4 yard completion"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Rush, zero yards"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Bad"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Mack"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: That throw to Mooney followed by kmet"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Fields is absolutely for real"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Is it just me or does it seem like Nagy called that drive?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: That last play at least"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Hated that call"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Why not be more aggressive? It’s still a 1 score game after the field goal"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Playing for the field goal, playing not to lose"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Felt weak"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Also I still love the fact we don't have to worry about kicking field goals anymore"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: He's automatic"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: I mean eventually he's gonna miss but it feels good man"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Drilled it"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Is he tho?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: He might not"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Bears win!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Fields now 2-1 as a starter."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: 🤔🤔"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: There is a woman having medical issues on my flight. Luckily there is an anesthesiologist and IM doc on board as well."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: I slowly backed away."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Lol. Cut em up with the knife from a silverware packet"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: She's having altered mental status."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: I confirmed not from blood loss or broken bones"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: So cut her brain"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: That looked like a broken play before the snap and Mahomes turned it into a TD"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: I'm assuming Allen west got covid and took a bunch of expensive and equally new monoclonal antibodies paid for by tax payers instead of some cheap preventive care"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Oh nevermind it was designed chaos. So that's where Nagy got that, just can't execute it"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: During which his body made an uncontrolled amount of spike proteins"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: What ever happened to those trick plays they used to design?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah. Pretty much"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: And his wife got the vaccine and didn’t go to the hospital"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Daniel Jones got a concussion, so next week Mike Glennon might play the Rams"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Aaron Donald gonna snap his long ass neck in half"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Nothing enriches big pharma less than extremely expensive experimental antibody infusions"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Libs don't want you to know that"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah. You shouldn’t get the vaccine that billions of people have gotten"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: You should get the antibodies like like tens of thousands of people have gotten"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Much less unknown"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: What are the long term studies on the mabs they made for covid?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: ￼ shouldn't you be practicing making babies?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Already did that"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Now I’m headed to dinner"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: The first Michelin star of the trip"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: What a turnaround for the NFC West. I feel like it was only a few years ago 7-9 won that division"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: AFC West is stacked too. Chargers and chiefs both Superbowl contenders"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Bills laying the smackdown first half tonight though. Every team in NFC West is good."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: We should invite Frank to this one too"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Fair"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: While we can’t say for sure, he doesn’t fit the typical QAnon profile"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Who knows how deep it goes"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Peter theil is gay also"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Not QAnon, but man i already censure myself for Joe"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: And an immigrant"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: I asked someone for an intro to Thiel once and he said he would if I was gay (this guy was gay too)"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Did you suck his dick"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Nah"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Have fun with your ordinary valuation"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: the heterosexual P/E ratio"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: He knew the secret tip touching handshake"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: And knew you’d embarrass him by not knowing it"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Oh come on! You don't need to be gay to know the STTHS"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I dunno... Look at how many times we've almost/actually fucked up the chats. 100% chance of Frank doing it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Joe ain't even there anymore anyway"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Oh yeah, how was the full download?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: He didn’t end up coming"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: The mystery remains"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: So elusive"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah. He had an unspecified “family emergency”"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: HIPPA violation to tell a friend why"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Man i hope it wasn't a dreaded ingrown toenail"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Might have been. Schmitty didn't advertise that God was going to be a part of the service so Trista blocked the trip"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: I like this theory"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Trista already wasn’t coming"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: But she probably does hold sway over Joe"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Honestly, we didn’t plan for it to be that religious."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: But my godfather is very religious and it was really important to me for him to do the ceremony"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: So after that we just sort of let him have free reign. I did not expect to have any prayer, let alone two, but oh well"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Doesn’t bother me. Just unexpected"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: DOUBLE PRAYER"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Well I don't know how the ceremony was at all because my kid is a dick"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: As a reference point over the last 12 hours he's gone potty twice, aka the same number of times he made me take him during the 20 minute ceremony"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: This is why i took fluids and engineering materials before spawning"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Schmitty do your part while on your honeymoon and go take a shit in the Pacific"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Max throw your jeans in there too while you're at it"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Mexico is doing their part"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: This is a great example because we don’t even fully understand what creates lift"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: As an aerospace engineer I cam confirm this. Aerodynamics makes no sense."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: *project manager"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah, Max. Stop using stolen valor"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Great comment, btw"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: I'm the spirit of things we don't acknowledge in front of Joe, anyone else notice that you can only get at-home covid tests from 3 retailers now?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Our meijer used to carry them. The pharmacist told Emily yesterday to stop wasting her time. Only Amazon, Walmart, and Walgreens are getting them"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: I recall an early coronavirus presser where Pence had all the corporate partners step forward. Walgreens was part of that. Sounds like there's cronie capitalism going on here."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I know last time I looked I couldn't find any and that was a couple weeks ago"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: What I've seen is that supposedly there's just not many out there because there's generally low demand for them from customers trying to get them at private retailers"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Walgreens will let you order them at normal prices. Amazon is higher. Never checked Walmart"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: I recall seeing that sales slumped with initial vaccination rollout, abbott slowed/stopped production, delta swept the world, and now there's a consistent supply shortage"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: That sounds right. What I had seen was maybe discussing that they didn’t expect any demand increase to be enough to justify amping production significantly."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Along a similar vane, we just got notification of the vaccine mandate meaning everyone at NG has to get their last dose NLT Nov 24"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Obviously I'm pro vaccine but this feels a little unconstitutional"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Right to work, babyyyy"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Yes let's add more governing bodies. More management more better!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Government pulled this stunt knowing anti vaxxers are also anti Union. Well played Biden maybe you still got it."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Wait, right to work is anti-government"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Oh I misread the shit out of that"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Lol. Yeah. It's specifically because the law doesn't step in to protect workers that companies can fire you for not getting a vaccine"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Just funny that right to work was a big anti-union push that worked and now a subset of those same people don't like the results because they have to get vaccinated"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Nah man, Allen West said \"science.\" with authority. Fuck this scientist with his \"data\"."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Talk shit, get hit"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: So much for your super immunity"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: I don't necessarily know how it's unconstitutional tho. There's nothing in the Constitution that says you can't mandate vaccines. seems to fit within OSHA"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Well now I have both natural and vaccine immunity. I'm basically indestructible"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: You've already proven your shit's weak by getting a breakthrough infection"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: I don't think the constitution explicitly addressed inoculation, but it's fair to say that our government was founded on being anti-government"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: The spirit of it all was \"fuck you. You can't tell me what to do\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: But then as government added services, they can control access. Driving privileges, schools..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Ellipsis and \"etc.\", the universal symbols for \"i dunno. That's all i can think of right now\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I mean, the way this will shake out will be good for my job security"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Spoken like a proper demonrat"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: But I feel like the government shouldn't be able to mandate something like a vaccine that will lead to people losing their jobs"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Although I personally would love to work for a company that has less than 100 people"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: It moves faster and more falls on your shoulders. Usually the balance of R&D vs revenue is out of whack so there's never any fucking money"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Yeah so they can't afford to have an 80% useless workforce like us big boys"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Going from a 70 to 8 person company, it is kind of nice how much you can slack off when most of the workforce is useless too"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: I miss those days of barely working"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Does allow me to attempt to day trade without internet access"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: It’s not unconstitutional. It might be if it was a federal mandate, depending on how it’s structured. But statewide vaccine mandates are clearly constitutional (as part of the “police powers”) and federal mandates for contractors/federal employees are clearly constitutional as well since there’s no limit on tying strings to federal funds."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: It is a federal mandate"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Not really"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: It’s vaccine or test"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: And then they limit the supply of tests so you can't get tested"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I agree with that part that the government should do more to promote availability of tests"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: No you can fuck off because your revenue doesn't cost the customer anything"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Yeah but it's gay if you fuck a dude monkey"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Apparently he worked at Battelle, which has allegedly done some UFO related consulting for the government"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Presumably (read: didn't research) Crenshaw lost his eye in combat, but what if it was something like \"lost his eye during a tour in Afghanistan\" but really it was \"lost his eye while on leave from a tour in Afghanistan when things got out of hand with a Filipino hooker\""}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Idk man. He called timeout"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Max already out on Fields"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Paper hands"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: 📃🖐"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: I’m glad I’m on the West Coast because now I can be disappointed by 1 PM and have the rest of the day to recover"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I’m not glad I’m on the west coast cause I’m flying home and about to land 9.5 hours after I left, mostly losing my Sunday"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: But I’ll manage"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Wish you got to stay here forever huh"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: No. I was starting to dream about hammers and sickles. Too scary"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: You submit eventually"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Max wears a Che Guevara patch on his shoulder now"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I did have to listen to an extremely annoying tech bro at dinner last night. He was eating with his girlfriend’s parents and her and spent a while talking about this company wide email he got from Elon Musk"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Then later talked about being promising at chess as a child but ultimately not pursuing it"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: The old \"i could have been in the Olympics if i trained harder\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Tech bros suck so hard"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Tech bros would make an app for sucking"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: lemons coming in nicely"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Pee on it"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: ....why"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Fertilizer"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Max you're dog ok?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Max you are dog ok"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: 😑"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: 😂"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Your missing a comma"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Max you are dog, ok"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: One nation, under dog"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Yeah appropriate emoji cause in my head I was saying this with a racist Asian access"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Accent"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I'll see if I can get his annoying honking on camera, he hasn't done it much since going to the vet"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Apparently no pharmacies carry hydrocodone/homatropine"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah. He had a braggy tone about it too. Like dude. It’s a company wide email"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: To put it in full context, he was a white guy and his girlfriend was Asian and didn’t say a word during the whole meal"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: You wish you were getting Elon’s company wide emails  instead of whatever Choate sends you"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: But seriously that’s hilarious how stereotypically tech bro that is"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I do. a16z is a client. I need to desperately try to get Andreessen to email me"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Elon musk sent me an email asking me to deposit $10000 in a bank account to invest in his new company, haters are furious"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: I hope the Rodgers I own you thing is playing on repeat at halas hall"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Make dumb ass George McCaskey fire everyone including himself"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: https://bearswire.usatoday.com/2021/10/18/bears-packers-eddie-jackson-jab-lance-briggs-criticism/"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: And fuck Eddie Jackson too. Dude sucks"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: They should probably focus more on the working conditions but $21/hr + $3k sign on is pretty good"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Especially when it’s setting a wage floor for others"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: It’s an average though so it’s unclear how much of a floor that is"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Pretty sure Eddie Jackson makes more than that"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Same with McCaskey, so I don't see Amazon in their future"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I like the idea with trying to find them new jobs though"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Yeah I really like the idea of finding them new jobs at Amazon warehouses"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: \"Most missed packages all tracked to Eddie Jackson\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: If bezos buys the team and moves us to Prime Field in Arlington heights, maybe we'll finally be competent"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: And he can throw George McCaskey a job in a warehouse as a bonus"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Fair point but but I think their actual minimum is $15/hr regardless of location, which does good to force other companies to pay more"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Plus he can entice free agents with free space rides"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Frank: ding dong"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Does that mean he wasn’t vaxxed?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Dark"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Rip Colon Powell"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Frank: Rest in piss"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: He helped bush do 9/11"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: The tag line for the next season of House of Cards where Spacey comes back"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: You know who else rested in piss?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: ^ finally someone who does their research"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: He calculated the steel beam melting temperature"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: I watched a 9/11 truther documentary this weekend called Loose Change, it’s on YouTube"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: You all need to wake up like Krishnan"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: A non trivial amount of the interviews were just other guys who had researched things on the internet"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I'll have to do my own research on Tik Tok like the people on Tik Tok that are so knowledgeable on all these topics"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I’ve never actually seen Loose Change but I had assumed this is basically what it was"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: 👉🏿 bush\nDid 👈🏿\n👉🏿 9\n11 👈🏿"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: That's what I imagine 9/11 conspiracy tik tok looks like"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Considering how anti Trump Powell was, I'm going to assume he was vaccinated. Just old and black which according to data is bad to combat COVID"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: There were a couple interesting things, like how there was nothing in the debris fields by the Pentagon or Shanksville. You could barely tell a plane crashed"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: And they conveniently found the intact IDs of most of the hijackers in the burning wreckage of the towers and Pentagon"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: But that’s kind of like cops sprinkling crack on homeless people, kind of standard procedure"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Didn’t know that and that is surprising"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Angel of death is racist apparently"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Should i know who this is?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: It's Ben Stein"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: /s"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: It's Henry Kissinger"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: He sucks too"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: He's just not a billion years old"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: When can we start shaking hands again."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I've been shaking hands for a couple months, now that the plandemic is over"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Yeah I want to but I'm in the weird in between. I think I need to start initiatjng again"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Love hand shakes"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah. Me too. I don't do it always. Kind of try to read the vibe and am less likely to do it if there's multiple people, in which case I'll just sort of nod/mini-bow"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: We should permanently move to fist bumps"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: I don’t like touching some peoples hands"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: I've noticed it when meeting patients that the more overtly maga ones always go for a handshake. Like the guy who when I asked if he had feather pillows, was like \"no I have a My pillow\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Yeah these people ^"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: You ask of they have feather pillows?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: In any case with patients I always put on gloves before entering a room, so I don't have a problem with it"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Depends why they're there but it's part of my evaluation for ILD patients"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Ah I see. Would mush be a red flag on my eval for ILD?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Mush disqualifies you from getting a lung transplant"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: 100% there is some fucked up mold in there"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: I would make you get rid of it"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Or no lung for you"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: No lung for me"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: We actually sometimes (rarely) do home visits for patients we suspect of being hoarders or in toxic environments pre or post transplant"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I mean we deduced that America is better with handshakes so it makes sense that handshakes are a pillar of making America great"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: So basically you're House"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: More like we send a nurse to throw out all their hoarded shit and make them get their house remediated lol"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: So like if House was a cop"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Dr Officer House"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Depends on the particular event. This one has a 4 mi trail loop for 12 hours during the day and a 4 mi road loop for 12 hours during the night. But it's the same loop 12x in a row before flipping."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Isn't that essentially a fast walking pace?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: It's pretty hard to walk 4mph and doing so would mean you got literally no rest."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: To make it that far you need to consistently do 10-12 min miles, which for these people is certainly easy for a while, but once you've got more than even 50 miles in your legs in another thing"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: 100 mile world record is just under 7 min miles over 11.25 hours."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: I'm down this rabbit hole now"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Information designer Edward Tufte has argued that the Challenger accident was the result of poor communications and overly-complicated explanations on the part of engineers, and stated that showing the correlation of ambient air temperature and O-ring erosion amounts would have been sufficient to communicate the potential dangers of the cold-weather launch."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: \"Bitch We said 'stop the launch' first\""}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: 🔫"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Lol. It’s really callously phrased but doesn’t seem to be something to worry about. Like companies aren’t going to pass up on making billions of dollars even if the product that does that “ends” or severely diminishes the market."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Why? If anything they’ll just “gouge” on pricing."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Not if the treatments to manage the disease are more profitable than the cures"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Eh. I don’t know. Maybe. But if I am company B whose competency is gene therapy and I can make a couple billion with a cure and my competitor has a patent on the treatment for disease X, why wouldn’t I make the cure? My competency isn’t small molecules or whatever and I can’t make this one anyway"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I either make the cure and get the billions or I get nothing"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: And if I don’t do it, why wouldn’t other competitor whose competency is also gene therapy jump on it?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: If you make billions annually off the treatment, and a small player comes in the scene with the cure, you buy them and mothball the cure"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: In automotive, GM has a published history of buying and shuttering disruptive technology startups"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Well that’s a pretty big antitrust violation at least on the bio side."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: It also should be one on GM’s part but the law is fairly watered down right now"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: This is really interesting but it doesn’t seem to support the contention that people will not develop cures if they can sell treatments. The treatment is non-pharmaceutical."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: It also doesn’t support Carter’s contention that people will buy up companies and mothball the tech"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: That's fair but the point is there are some diseases with cures that aren't available because they're unprofitable"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah. I think the difference is it was actually commercialized (unsuccessfully), so the remedy should be targeted based on what actually happened."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Like a compulsory patent license for non-commercialization of a successful clinic candidate after X years may be appropriate"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Certainly once the patents expire then someone will come in and make it. But 20ish years seems unfairly long to make people wait"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I also don’t know the specifics of that case that well. Maybe Canada is fucking up on the orphan drug front. The US has somewhat good legislation to promote them but it’s mostly carrots when there could/should be more sticks also"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I didn't feel like working so I looked up what data was available on FRED (whose source is Realtor.com). Using median home size of housing inventory of the boroughs and populations weighting them, you get 729 sq ft vs. 1280 sq ft for SF, which makes the price per square foot to be $1138 for SF and $1095 for NY. So Matt was mostly right, the difference is mostly accounted for in size. The data seem odd for Queens though. It shows a median home size of 545 sq ft whereas even Manhattan is still 720 sq ft, which could be believable but weirdly there aren't any data before April 2020, unlike the other boroughs."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: ￼ what is the actual law here? Criminal negligence?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Man's laughter"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: But Alec Baldwin is rich. No charges."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Uhh. Yeah. It could be manslaughter or second degree murder (seems doubtful on that based on what little detail we have). Seems like it would be hard to prove manslaughter too. Seems more like a civil claim, maybe against Baldwin but more convincingly against the person who was responsible for the gun and/or was in control of the scene at the time."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Even that could be doubtful. If for example it was a blank that just went stray and no one particularly told the woman who died to stand where she was standing then it might just be purely accidental so everyone acted “reasonably”"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: I really don't care that there are props specialists. Finger on the trigger is responsible"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Blanks don't go stray. They don't contain a projectile. Something has to be in the barrel"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Eh. I think that mindset is right but negligence depends on what convention is in the circumstances"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: If the convention is specialist maintains the gun and actor fires where and when told then negligence on the actor’s part is going to be hard to prove"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: I read something on Reddit about the protocols that are in place for live fire. It's ridiculous what lengths they are supposed to go. Something fucked up bad"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah. They really should just use an air soft gun and add in muzzle effects in post"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Even the military uses a blank suppressor"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Like a little cap at the end to prevent strays from discharging something in the barrel"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: But Hollywood doesn't cause it looks marginally goofy and you wouldn't see muzzle flare"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: i guess a muzzle brake would be anachronistic"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: I mean I feel like they'd say that an actor handed a gun as part of filming a movie while on set would #reasonably 👆🏿 expect it to be safe to fire"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Best argument for Baldwin’s criminal/civil liability is something like, regardless of what system is in place, anyone holding a gun knows they shouldn’t fire towards someone else even with a blank because a gun is so inherently dangerous and so it’s unreasonable to have fired it how he did. Best (and in my non-legal opinion better) counter is that (a) guns are inherently dangerous so the deceased/injured assumed the risk by being on set during filming where it would be discharged and (b) Baldwin only discharged the gun in the manner in which he was instructed and therefore he acted reasonably in the circumstances (which he could separately use to try to argue any liability he would have should transfer to his employer)."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: On an unrelated note, my doctor's office is complete shit at answering phones and scheduling appointments, but it's right next to my house. I sat on hold the entire commute home then just walked in and scheduled an appointment"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: It's really not difficult to check the barrel for obstructions yourself"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah. But the legal theory rests on whether he had a duty to do that or not. Arguably in the circumstances he didn't, it was the duty of the prop supervisor."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: But it's reasonable to assume that's been done by the people who have the job of making sure a prop is safe to use"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Goddamn being a lawyer is fucking easy"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Lol. Mostly. Being a good lawyer is relatively hard"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: I said nothing about being a good lawyer"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Negligence requires you establish a duty of care first even before you question reasonableness in discharging the duty. Based on what we know right now, Baldwin could challenge both prongs"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: (One of the duties is literally \"duty of care of a reasonable person.\" haha. But what that is is context dependent. It's reasonable care in the context of the situation, which might simply be that Baldwin asked the prop supervisor \"is this gun good to fire?\" or maybe even just only handled guns given to him by the supervisor without any further questions/checks)"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: The ol meatfork strategy.  Gotta challenge both prongs"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: There's two other prongs but he's got no arguments there"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Causation and damage"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Lol"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: So regular fork them"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Meat fork works. I think they're fairly strong prongs of defense (unless more facts come out that change the picture)"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Looks like this Build Back Better Act is about to fuck up everyone’s childcare"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: It can get worse?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: 🔪"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Lol. Well currently they’re centering on a requirement that childcare providers be paid teachers’ wages with a subsidy for lower income earners to help afford it but the subsidy has a drop off (not phase out) that’s currently at 100-130% of median income by state for the first three years (before there being no drop off)"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: But it looks like the drop off is headed towards being indefinitely capped at 200% or 150% of median household income"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Cool, so i guess Emily will just leave the workforce. Good plan"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: So people just past the cutoff will be having a very hard time finding childcare that isn’t wicked expensive"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: The irony is that’s the likely outcome"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Love to make programs completely trash in order to make them slightly cheaper"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Or even better make them more expensive and completely trash by adding means testing bureaucracy"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah. I'm a single issue voter and my issue is that someone of moderately high income can't get even one $300 payment from the government ever because otherwise society will collapse"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Day care teacher wages are in price discovery right now because it's a fairly demanding job that pays poorly. The labor market was handling their wages at least"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah. Idk. The universal pre-k debate was so weirdly focused on child outcomes, which appear to not be affected by participation much based on recent research, when there's been no focus on allowing parents to work. Conservatives are so obsessed with people working and then don't pay any attention to barriers to that goal"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: To that end, providing a subsidy makes sense. Requiring some wage floor vs. just letting the subsidy act to provide wage pressure is debatable - I don't really have an opinion"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: \"Great for 3 hour YouTube videos\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: There he is!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: So do I get to pay less or no because I'm not poor enough"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: You get to pay more"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Wait seriously"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Was that not obvious? Pay floor is going to be mandated, so costs will go up"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Yeah no fucking shit they should not approve that"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Or I'll file for divorce and call myself a business so the government doesn't fuck me anymore"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Also a big influx of people who can now afford to because they are getting the subsidy but you aren’t"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: And actors play with cold guns all the time, so they get lulled into false sense of security. Like nobody thought it was even possible"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah. I was going to say that too. I could see how if Alec Baldwin is never around \"real\" guns and frequently around prop guns, his perspective gets warped/dulled"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Shit if I was on set filming and someone told me they handed a cold gun I would also assume it was cold. Except I work with a bunch of people who don't do their job so I know better"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: I wouldn't assume it was unloaded, and that's why my body count is still 0"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: You should take AB's role in the movie"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: The real tragedy is that a real bullet was fired on set only a few days earlier and nobody fucking checked to make sure the armorer wasn't retarded after that"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: That's like the craziest part"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: How that didn't just shut everything down"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Why the fuck did they ever have live ammunition on this set?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Why even once"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: And that's where I could see someone making an argument for AB's liability as producer. That they should have immediately fired the armorer or whoever else"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: I mean they tried to shut it down with everybody leaving"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: What do you mean? I think the union issues were separate"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Because she’s a dumb dumb"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Supposedly some of the prop people really wanted to fire the antique guns and so had took them out shooting and then someone some of the live ammo carried over onto set, or something along those lines"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Maybe I misread but a lot of the staff ended up leaving the set because they were worried about safety issues"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Ah. Maybe. I hadn't seen that. I do know that a big part of the union staff walked out over working conditions but my understanding was it had to do with things like length of day and compensation."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: That's also ill-advised. At some point you just call a gun a \"wall hanger\" because it's so old that you can't trust it to hold up to the pressures anymore. My dad has a beautiful double barrel 10 ga shotgun that he has never nor will never fire because it was built when barrels were built by hammering sheet steel around a dowel"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Any given ammunition specifies the pressure it's loaded to generate from the beginning, so antique weapons fired with modern ammunition should still fire at the same pressures it was built for, but they still weren't made with modern manufacturing techniques"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Stop using so much logic and reasoning. These are the same people who think changing a gun emoji to a water gun makes it safer"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: It worked for him"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I could see if you had bad allergies that it would improve. Small reduction from the mask. Big boost from not generating a ton of mucus / added benefit of no constant sneezing"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Man what a horrible plumbing problem. Fine if you're on the top floor i guess..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: MMT does get weirdly hung up on the dogma that taxes don’t pay for anything when it should be more like taxes don’t matter in terms of paying for things."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Why don’t they matter?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Because we can print money. Our ability to finance government spending is in no way contingent on taxation in an economic (or constitutional) sense."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I’m not saying there can’t be issues with government spending"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: So when the government collects taxes, that doesn’t go into a bank somewhere?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Bank(s)"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: They do go into accounts and they get spent!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: I hope it’s one though"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Which is why the simplistic MMT take is dumb."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Can we just get rid of pennies and maybe even nickels at this point? Like is anything worth less than a dime anymore?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: A penny"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: But our ability to spend the money that the taxes covered wasn’t predicated on receiving the taxes"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: We could have printed it instead."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: But that devalues the money, which disproportionately affects the have-nots. It's a regressive tax, doubly so because it inflates the dollar value of an asset with a fixed intrinsic value"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: You can argue \"but the money spent by the government can provide for the have-nots\" but that doesn't actually keep the machine moving and providing things in abundance"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: MMT recognizes you can’t just flood the system and so counters that taxes are a way to balance the system by taking money out of it. Their counter to my point is that taxes are just receiving back money that the government created in the first place so my critique is invalid but that’s dumb - banks also create money that’s taxed so clearly not all taxes are government originated"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Money doesn't create goods and services. People and machines do"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: How does congress create money if only the Fed can do that? I thought the Fed was independent"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Through the treasury"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Which auctions off bonds"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: As well as keeps other banks’ required reserves"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: And given Biden's inflation plan, my $13M RMD in 2059 is actually worth $100k in today's dollars"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Frank: Wait till you see the prices on goods when our arable farmland starts migrating north! Wonder how much coffee, vanilla and chocolate will cost when there’s no longer a place on earth that can produce them outside. 🤣"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Frank: Inflation is as much determined by productivity as it is money supply."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Frank: Congress can order the treasury to mint a $2 trillion dollar coin. They can then pay any debt issued by the fed using that coin. So the logistical question of where the money gets printed is essentially irrelevant."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Oh, I guess he only just came out today and as part of that announcement also announced he is engaged"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: You forgot to add \"rocks are trees\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Welcome to Joe Biden's America... where drugs are stopped at the border. Smh"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: The thing about fentanyl is that it can be synthesized locally. It says a lot about our choked up supply lines that even international conglomerates like drug cartels would rather manufacture elsewhere and ship"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: LOL"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Dems should make unionized fentanyl manufacturing part of the BBB Agenda"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: For real what about any of that goes against historical \"war on drugs\" conservatism?"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I mean sometimes you just got the dementia real bad some days but you still need to own the libs"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: And your wires get crossed"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: If anything, I'm disappointed that Biden is still pushing the war on drugs. I thought we were in the business of getting out of pointless, expensive wars"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Well his pill numbers really took a hit when we dipped out of Afghanistan, maybe he learned his lesson about ending pointless war"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Well apparently 1/4 of the world's population would die if we abruptly pulled out of the war on drugs"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: A timely reminder"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Pulling out has never been more enticing"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: It’s kind of crazy to me that the coin shortage thing is still going on"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Is this all from the \"no digital money\" crowd?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Is what all?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Continued coin shortage. Are people hoarding coins specifically in protest of digital currency?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Oh. I doubt it. I guess that’s possible but seems like a Too Online thing to affect normal society"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I think it’s just that there’s still a lot of change at home that people aren’t circulating. I’m just surprised that’s still true"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I mean I never spend change when I get it. It's extremely inconvenient and one of the big reasons I avoid cash. That and CCs are free money"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I told a guy this morning I love the bike, unsure about the stock lol"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Lol. Yeah. I don't know anything about the company but it's not surprising that the price was inflated by hype that won't hold up long term. It seems like they benefited massively from a first mover advantage that's fading fast. It's not my thing but it doesn't seem like the brand itself has that much core value and the physical and subscription products are easily copied"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: *that the price could be inflated"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I wouldn't be surprised if long term the space evolves into the hardware and classes being separate companies. They just seem like pretty different companies even though they're used together"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Why would a hardware company let anyone run software on their bikes? The software has all the nice margins"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: My stupid Aunt finally caught the Rona!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah, that may be the case. That's clearly how it's played out so far. One could envision a model where they cross licensed branding and/or got some sort of royalty from the different class companies to integrate them with the bike."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: She been hanging with Aaron?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Probably. My cousin's (her daughter) wedding is in 2 weeks too"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Also, given that it's not pure software - there's instructor salaries etc. involved - I wonder how the margins actually compare"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I'm kinda hoping they're not fully recovered by then"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Nah he was \"vaccinated\". Wouldn't want to go near the bio weapon"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: You're a diiiick...."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: I respect it"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: They still scale really well."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Don't care enough to look at a 10K though"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: What does batman like with his whiskey?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: JK, their May 10Q says gross margin on \"connected fitness products\" for nine months ending March 31, 2021 is ~33% (was 42% for 2020, but unclear whether change was pandemic related)"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Gross margin on subscriptions was 65%"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: JUST ICE!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Surprisingly low"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: But their connected fitness products sales were 1.02B and only 239M for subscriptions"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: So profit was still ~2/3 from products and only 1/3 from subscriptions"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I'm honestly surprised at that split given that the product is like 2k and the recurring subscription is like, what, 30-50$/mo?"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: You guys ever see other kids that look like your kid but like if something bad happened?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: When i walked into daycare today there was a full Asian baby that looked like Mark if his face and forehead had swollen up from something and i had a fright like \"oh shit we're going to the hospital! \" until i realized it's just some other kid but ugly"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Did you stick around to have a laugh with the other parent about it? Seems like a good way to make a friend"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Absolutely not! They charge extra if you don't leave on time"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Yeah parents love “hey your kid is ugly AF, what happened?\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: I'll have to ask your parents about if that's true"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Nah even fat sister was a cute kid once"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: There's an age where cute and chubby turns to old and fat"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I'm so good looking I didn't have to stand in front of a mirror and say \"God I'm good looking\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Didn’t realize I needed to add an /s"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I was also being serious"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Parents of ugly kids still love talking about their kids"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: What a picky little pedo"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: The age seems to fall around 18"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Debate settled"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Frank: Kumar plays for my team 🎉"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Congrats, Frank"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Are you Josh?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: I almost told Frank that it's old news that Kal Penn is gay and if he wasn't paying attention when discussing the other day. But I realize that we had that convo here."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I WAS JUST ABOUT TO DO THE SAME AND CAME HERE TO CHECK"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I was like Typical Frank, catching up on the conversation late"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Why did this turn into a -Frank chat?"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: But have you met me? I once sat down to dinner with Schmitty and some friends and just started telling stories about this fascinating jew i was working with who 1. Went by Tully the jew 2. Was jacked 3. Was still diabetic and 4. Carried a handgun everywhere so he would have to lay it down before fitting into tight spaces... at customer sites"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Also found along the way"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Until finally one of the other guests yelled at me like \"do you have a problem?!\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: https://www.gawker.com/celebrity/jay-z-immediately-deletes-instagram-in-historys-first-correct-use-of-social-media"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: This way i can still say things like \"is it deadnaming if i still call it Facebook?\" and it'll just rub Schmitty a little wrong"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I suggested we had him here too! But at this point it may be too late. Pretty awkward to invite him to the one chat and only invite him to the other one weeks later"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Speaking of which, I'm responding to this in the other chat"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: In other news, I watched the Chapelle special last night that got the trans community all pissed off"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: How was it"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I guess he's been called transphobic a lot, so he really leaned into it. Chapelle is funny AF"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: I haven't seen all his new specials but this one wasn't as funny as bird revelation or equanamious or whatever it was called"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Definitely not as funny as the old ones"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: I think my biggest probably with his transphobic jokes is you can imagine word for word Carlos mencia saying them."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: there's no anti trans joke that hasn't been done over and over and over"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Historically, I'd say Dave has had a pretty consistent outlook on all these identity issues, namely \"to what extent am i required to participate in your self- image?\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: It applies broadly, and i think it rings true. Within that framework you can really just be at peace with who you are and accept others for who they are"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Apparently to the extent of him making a whole hour long Netflix special being anti trans"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: The new frontier will be obnoxiously pro-trans, like amateur bodybuilder big Lenny"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I mean the whole thing isn't anti trans"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: I did say \"historically\". I haven't watched the special"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Chris Pratt got shit on for a post being thankful for his beautiful, healthy baby girl because his son with Anna Faris was not healthy. People take what they want and shit on it"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: A large part of it is how he discovered he's a feminist despite women telling him he's anti woman too"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Oh man... I've got stories about my super-feminist Ex vs the woman i married"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah. I think there’s a larger trend towards always interpreting everyone else’s (especially those who are not ideologically similar) actions and words as being in bad faith"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Which is proof that the reader is acting in bad faith"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Maybe/likely but gotta stop the cycle somehow"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Summary is that my wife is a highly capable, dedicated woman who does what it takes and doesn't claim the world is biased against her. She just knocks shit out"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Big chunk of it"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Idk I don't really even have a problem with the special, I think what annoys me is that he made it, knowing he'd piss people off which is totally fine for a comedian"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: But then he cries about cancel culture"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: He knowingly did it to be controversial so don't come crying when controversy finds you"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: The whininess comes for the best of em eventually"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Affluenza not just limited to teens"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah, not saying this about Chapelle per se but there is a strong element of begging the question amongst prominent cancel culture critics"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Yeah but he's bitching about it during the special, and really they're just proving him right"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah but to Krishnan’s point. If you know that what you’re saying will get that reaction, then why are you having the respondent reaction?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Just say the controversial thing and let it be"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: He also bitched about it after in a super whiny way"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Because he's trying to save America obviously"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Sounds like Krishnan hates Chapelle and therefore black people"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: That's what I've gathered"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Chapelle still is the GOAT to me. This is just his Jordan on the wizards phase"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: So yesterday i was telling a coworker a story about a tenant that the FBI arrested for grooming underage girls online in a conversation about just how much is tracked and released to the federal government"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: So just to be clear: you’re pro-grooming then?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: He interrupted with \"is he Jewish?\" \"No, i don't think so...\" \"is disgusting... they say it's within their religion to do whatever they want to non- Jewish women\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: I searched some careful terms to try to figure out where these ideas were coming from and the top result was a white nationalist periodical"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Definitely calls for an incognito tab at a minimum"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: And a VPN"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Duck duck go, but also i searched something like \"history of jewish men mistreating non jewish women\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: And a self report, if you’re Max"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: And man, the comments section!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Should have added “FOR HISTORICAL RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY”"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: (PARODY)"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: I've actually never heard that about Jewish dudes. That's a new stereotype for me"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: (#)MeToo"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I feel like it’s just the anti-Semitic version of a more mild general sentiment"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: The conservative sect(s) of any religion have regressive attitudes about women"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: And are more prone to treat them poorly"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Because they're inferior"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I really want a plug in... Kia has the Sorrento phev and dealers are adding $7500 to MSRP at the dealership"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Well once they pass (?) the BBB, it’ll have that expanded EV credit"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Which won't balance out the upcharge and price increase. I'm also cheap and don't need a new car at all (27.5k on the Rogue)"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: You could buy an aftermarket Tesla badge and slap it on your Rogue then?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I'm tired of having to go to the gas station that one time a month"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: You only get gas during during your period?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Only time I need it"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: 👏🏽👏🏽"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Also MTG toured a DC prison yesterday and came out in favor of prison reform. Will be really interesting to see if that turns into anything?"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Well that’s why they ended the trial early"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: It clearly worked so well it was unethical to continue to withhold the treatment"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: That's great news. Still rather people get vaccinated because of what we know about the chronic issues with covid"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: But at least peeps will die less."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: He's not Bono"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Question: are you also shitting on him or are you providing examples of people shitting on him?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: I expect entertainment from him and not much else. And his transgressions are largely within the realm of normalcy"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Nah it's a real question"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Frank: I think we’re in a time where tradwife nazi shit is on the rise"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: I'm tempted to say \"that's not true. My wife's not traditional\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Frank: And it’s not helpful for entertainers to feed it"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: What's tradwife Nazi shit"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Have not heard the term tradwife"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Had to look it up. Traditional wife"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Frank why do gay people like to abbreviated things?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: I dunno. Seems like rich people shit to me. We prefer dual income"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Frank: lol"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Frank: Tradwife came from traditional wife but it describes a subculture"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: ￼ Because they're cocksuckers!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Which part does Crisp rat feed exactly?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: *C-Sucks"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: From a source other than Twitter"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Frank: Something new and unsettling (to some) that takes a aesthetic form of a past thing"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: I say this coming from a stance of not knowing shit about his personal life and generally thinking he's entitled to keep it personal up until about \"basement girlfriend\" status"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: E.g. ?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Frank: I’ll elaborate more later but my uber just arrived👋"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Frank: Part of the controversy is that his last partner had a kid with health problems"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Yeah but if you never had that fact and you heard someone was thankful for their healthy baby you wouldn't think twice. If it was his first and only child and he said the same thing it would not be considered an issue"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Frank: Yeah"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah, I agree. What Chris Pratt said can be thoughtless without being deliberately mean"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Frank: But you could just make everything fine without context lol"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Frank: It was that combined with the “girl has this place” thing in the rest of the post that set off some bells"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: But what's the context? I'm not going to begrudge them having some trad tendencies just because."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Frank: The context of his last relationship"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah, idk, that's just reading really deep into a commonly used phrase."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Frank: And the context of visible nazi resurgence"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: That Chris Pratt is now responsible for?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Frank: Not responsible for lol"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Frank: I’ll get on that when I have a moment to throw in the trash"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: 🤷🏾‍♂️"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Frank: Pratt will be totally fine with his genetically perfect child dude no need to get your tits in a twist over a little controversy"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Frank is growing into his role as substitute heel well"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Frank: Everyone’s made to be afraid of “cancel culture” by these substack charlatans"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Frank stop using big words like charlatans, tradwife and tits. Makes me feel dumb"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: That wasn't the point of the post. It's interesting to hear the perspective of the disabled person in relating to a story that similarly involves a disabled child of a famous couple"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Second one is \"cis\"?"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: I feel a bit bad that our new heel is the gay one, but damned if he's not out calling a pretty regular guy a nazi"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I did really like the leap that somehow Chris Pratt needs to carefully craft what he says because of the alt right or whatever"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Wow what a back pedal this guy is doing"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: There's where I fall on the other side of the cancel culture debate. Let guys be dudes"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: But that sounds very similar to Let guys be douche"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: 🤷🏻‍♂️"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Never stopped me before"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: No way, is that real?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: It’s a reporter for The Athletic"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: So idk. Seems like it’s not obviously a joke enough to be doing from your journalist account"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: That's allowed. Society tends to work these things out"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I found a video clip. It’s real"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: He’s been taking monoclonal antibodies, zinc, vitamin C, ivermectin, and HCQ"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: He's been pretty pro vaccine"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Yep I saw your link"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I mean that's all that Chris Pratt said"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I'll finish the 3 hour YouTube video next time before jumping to conclusions"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Do he think he had a slide deck for his antivax pitch to the NFL?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Dude y'all need to watch the interview with Pat McAfee. It's like watching a train wreck. And I was right. Pat just let him talk, which is out of character for Pat, he usually talks over everyone."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: When he mention Rogan, Pat put his hand over his mouth to keep from laughing"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Best interviewing technique. Let him dig his own grave lol"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: https://youtu.be/K3jM13A7OEw"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Man he's full of shit"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Well... He's not wrong that a lot of the protocols are stupid. But that's been the case this whole time. And trying to force people to get vaccinated makes them resist it more"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: You're still gleefully describing coercion"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: He said one bit that's definitely bullshit, which is that the narrow immunity from the vaccine encourages new variants. Only time in new hosts creates new variants. If you're calling viruses by their place of origin, it's safe to call the variants names like \"the Florida virus\" but perhaps this one came from a delta airlines flight so it's already covered"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Who cares"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: I only get 2 minutes into plenty of videos. I understand"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: No I just had to finish taking a dump"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: It's just dumb, the all cause mortality argument"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Those deaths in the vaccine group are equally distributed among a bunch of different causes of death, not one like \"heart attack\" or \"cardiomyopathy\""}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: These are the causes of death just FYI"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: When are you bitches going to start publishing tables with gridlines?"}

I’m sympathetic to the idea that we should try to maximize personal liberty but the vaccine mandates are a pretty mild infringement of that and I think opponents are more shocked by the newness and immediate pervasiveness of the mandates than the actual requirement"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Because they fail to realize how many other similar mandates we already have that basically no one cares about"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: That's cause they're fuckin stupid"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Right. Well... I'm drunk you see"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: It is a leader's job to inspire people so they want to do things. Not mandate and force them because they're in charge. It wasn't just Trump supporters not getting vaccinated."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: It's like handing ￼ data that aliens exist. People are going to believe what they want to"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah. I get what you're saying. By the same notion, I think there's basically no version of a president that would inspire them to get the vaccine"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: A mandate at least has the benefit of not making it a choice anymore. You just have to."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I do think the Pfizer antiviral changes the calculus though. I still think people should get the vaccine but a mandate is less important or arguably unnecessary"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: This is just the slippery slope argument. This is a particular problem with a particular solution that has a really positively asymmetric risk profile. No one serious is advocating more than mandating the solution. \"What next?\" counterarguments are reductio ad absurdum"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: 4chan"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I've got bad news about raising the average IQ of an entire population"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: It never works out because higher IQ leads to less reproduction?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: No, IQ is a normalized measure"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: So the average is always 100"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Yeah but if 100 was me vs my sister that's net positive"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I WANT TO GET RID OF STUPID PEOPLE"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Thought that was alt-right"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Sure but you mean raising the average intelligence of the human population is a good thing"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: How about r/antiwork"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Sorry I confused \"intelligence\" with \"intelligence quotient\""}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Good punchline"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: That’s actually a good one"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Thank you"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Great rec, Carter 👍"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: 🐋💦"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: You think that will happen?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Probably like all 50 of them will, yes"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: It’ll be a weird day for those 50"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: As short staffed as things are, it would only take like 2 people calling in at a best buy for it to turn to shit"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: The hard part for them is they’re all distributed and there isn’t an obvious location to center on like the Capitol Hill riots"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: But like Carter said, maybe a few strategic employees walking out in a lot of places could cause chaos. Black Friday is already a shit show to begin with"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah, here's the thing"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I think it won't be that noticeable to consumers and will just make their coworkers' lives bad for that day"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Yeah probably"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: It is interesting to see that, for example, meat processing plants have been having an extraordinarily hard time filling jobs"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: They're even up to offering like $20/hr with 3k signing bonuses and they still get basically zero applicants"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: The labor market has finally tilted a bit in the workers' favors, which is great"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: They're magnets for immigrants. Probably has more to do with unrelated politics"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: The former is definitely true but I don't know that that lends causality to the latter claim. There are still a lot of US workers and regardless, it doesn't negate that a big increase in wages isn't enough to lure in US workers"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: I'm not going to be upset if the net result is that places just put larger, unfinished cuts on shelves"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: But i doubt that'll be the end of it"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Small lemon. Good sized tangerine"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Not as easy to peel as store bought and not as sweet yet"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Lemon is good"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: No instead meat prices are going to double. Already up 28%"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I actually think it won't be that bad. They've been pumping supply chain issues so much I think everyone is going to buy as much stuff early as possible and if it's advertised to be chaos then it'll be super calm"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Texas instruments, ST Micro..."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: I haven’t fucked with a TI since high school"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: The supply chain issues are real, there really are labor shortages and shipping container logistical issues"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: LA port was really backed up with container ships, they made some changes recently to help"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: It’s kind of funny actually, it was really bad and then some guy took a boat and noticed the containers were only stacked 2 high so he got the mayor to lift a restriction so they could stack more up"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: I keep reading that there are truckers idling waiting for containers all the time, so I guess the bottleneck is mostly in crane operators? I've also heard that the trailers are just scattered about the country"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Yeah we have definitely been experiencing the shortages. Parts normally take 4 weeks to get are taking 4 months"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: At different times, we have dedicated a team to finding equivalent pcb components and finding equivalent cabling products.

{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: No meat packing issues here"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Some things are really back up. I bought some furniture that won’t be delivered for a few months."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Frank: Thip thip thip thip"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: The port is still pretty back up but hopefully starting to ease a bit. Some of the problem is that it isn’t that far off capacity but demand for goods is up 10-20% over trend."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: ESL all of a sudden?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: This was funny that it played out that way. Though the guy runs a logistics company so he had more than an idle curiosity in renting the boat"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Hmm? It should say “backed up” both times but I got Jonas’d by my phone"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I think some of the issue with the trucks is related to rules about how they can store containers"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Not just the stacking issue"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Like something with having to store containers on chassis once out of the port and there’s not enough chassises"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: That was during 2020 tho"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: One of the things I bought that’s not going to take that long is a bookcase that’s being delivered from France"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: And the shipping tracking is more detailed than I’ve ever seen"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: So I’m curious to see how it progresses"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: You're such an old man"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: True but it’s not a stodgy bookcase. It’s modern"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: What's it look like"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: On the flip side, I just ordered a made to order couch that is being delivered before the end of November so it does seem to vary widely even amongst furniture"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: From whom?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Design Within Reach"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Does it match the neutral tones you tend to wear?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: It does!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Although I wear more color than I used to"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: But the rug for where the couch is matches the colors I now wear"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I wonder if this will pan out better than his grand theory for physics"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Tell tale sign of a con artist"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Free thinker"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah. My guess is that he’ll get mostly shut down but there is some milquetoast point in there that he’ll motte and bailey back to when challenged"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: But who knows until he presents!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: At least he’s presenting it for critique"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: God he’s such a tool though"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah. Apparently the Zoom/presentation is closed to non-UChicago people but I hope a recording leaks out"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I don’t want to watch the whole thing and wouldn’t understand it but I want to see the tenor of the back and forth during the discussion"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: My favorite quack scientists’ theory of everything is Stephen Wolfram’s. He thinks the universe is basically a Turing machine but with multiple processing heads or basically flows of time"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: LOL"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: That's a good one"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Also love the field bias in his theory"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Dude are you sure she's asian?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Bo and her family pick every piece if anything off the bone. Looks like scavengers have been by when she eats wings"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: I checked. It's slanted"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Mainland shit"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: So Bo is like a Chinese hick?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: no that's apparently how Chinese people eat in general"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: This is offensive to me"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: But then Bo does weird shit like eat shrimp tails"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: So is this"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: But that’s where their poo is"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Poo is stored in the balls"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Not right now it's not"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Yeah that's way better than expected"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: It's pee you stupid orrho"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Orrho mmmhmm"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Got him"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Joey Hsu ate some weird shit that was all I remember"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Fucking pickled chicken feet in our fridge"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: And now he's diabetic"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: t's close to what you'd pay for a $300k house in IL. And you'd have to live in IL"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: I always thought picnic tables were manufactured, not bred"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: get it hawk"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: He's just chilling now"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Asshole just flew off"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Just hates pigeons"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: I'm so not excited that \"yes\" is winning"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: 10% of an S&P company sells off at once? That's going to ripple. Don't forget the largely unregulated options markets. Might turn into trillions"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Otoh that’s only double average daily volume"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Well if it’s $20 billion that’s roughly equal to daily volume"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Man thank god Jordan Love sucks"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: My heart couldn't take it if they just had another Hall of Fame QB"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: https://twitter.com/jkass99/status/1457489232906227715?s=21"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Can confirm"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Frank: Pretty sure they’re also adding in the ability to write off losses"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Yeah but you may end up with a tax liability in a year you didn't generate any cash to cover it. It's a bullshit proposal"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Frank: I think folks making $100 million in income should be well cushioned enough to cover that lol"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: But that’s sort of the point, isn’t it? Not saying I agree. But if the threshold is high, then I’m ok with them having to liquidate partially"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: To cover a 1-2% tax"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: One proposal I agree with more is to tax loans secured by securities"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Frank: It will add an interesting mechanic to the market game."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Cause that’s definitely a bullshit way to avoid taxes"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Is this how Max's FIL paid for Rachel's college?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I think that’s what he said"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: What Max said that is"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I’ll tell you what. I strongly don’t recommend going to school for four years while you work full time at a real job"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: The fourth year sucks"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Funny shithead behavior"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: CS while working already damn near killed me. I know"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Says the guy whose pp like like a BBC"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Cs?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Computer Science"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: I love that Elon does this whole atlas shrugged routine when his company would have been DOA without a huge loan from the government and EV subsidies"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Oh. I just assumed that it was referring to the degree and not the field the degree was in"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Ah. MS CS"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Yeah I don't know the specifics other than there is some collateral he had to put up. But she could take more of that money out if she wanted to I'm pretty sure"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Damn he’s going to eat that pigeon"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Oh he did. Feathers everywhere"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Also for anyone wanting to feel better about themselves: I had taco Bell last night and McDonald's for lunch today"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: And taco Bell again tonight for dinner"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: That’s just economical"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: But I'm still going to destroy some 40 year old women on the Peloton tomorrow"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Sounds like you’re going to destroy your shorts too"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: I just had a hot chicken sandwich with a side of french fries, layered with Mac and cheese and topped with a chicken tender."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: And banana pudding to wash it down."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: The most surprising part of this is how good I've felt"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Like level 2 or 3 poops"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I honestly don't remember the scale but this morning I didn't even need to wipe"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: I think 4 was ideal, 1 is constipated, 6 is explosive diarrhea"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: this morning I was running and had to stop after a mile to drop a 5.5 then got back on"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Like that time you barfed while walking without missing a step, you’ve got a knack for this"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: What was your mi/minute including shit break?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Thats what I do baby"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: That's a good question. I ran at 7.4mph the whole time but don't remember exactly how long I pooped for"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Next time I'll try to do a better accounting"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Ok I lied the gas is hitting hard now"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: If your bike wasn't stationary, then the gas would help make you go faster."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: The true freedom of trail running is that you can pretty much poop wherever mid run."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: I just learned that Amazon has a distribution center 3 miles from the Mexico border because you can bring Chinese goods through Mexico without incurring the tariff"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: So likely the biggest single player skirted the tariff"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Nice"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Do you bring tp with you?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: I thought about asking this, but 50% of available answers are one i don't want to know"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Nah. Just use leaves."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Shroedinger's butthole"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Or snow if it’s winter"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Damnit!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: 🤷🏽‍♂️"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: You've collapsed the quantum state!"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Interesting. Seems like perhaps a rosy outlook of what it means to \"onboard 500M web2 users into web3 and then there is no going back\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: But we'll see"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: WW3 started today"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Activia vs Taco Bell taking place as we speak"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Roshan can mail you some reinforcement capsules"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: But they'll probably result in more casualties"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: It could be terrible for Reddit, basically means you can exchange karma for money. But it’ll be an interesting social experiment"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Who’s winning?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Not Max's tumtum"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Throwback Joe trigger just for old times sake"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Lol Hiroshima was a Joe trigger?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: The battlefield always loses"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: The hidden 6th C, war Crimes"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Shit finna be like Hiroshima, a crime against humanity"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Oh wait the triggers were Is"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Incindiery devices? Idk I'm reaching"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: world war “I/II”"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Schmitty and me got in an argument with him over \"is nuking a civilian population a good thing\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Could be a quagmire like Vietnam or Afghanistan"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Whatever I that was, it was a weird stance for him to take"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Where Max ends up stuck in a mess of his own making for 40 years"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: He wasn’t arguing we should have done it prospectively. He was arguing that even now, knowing what we know about how pointless it was, it was a good thing."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Not terribly surprising of a stance"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Oh hell yeah"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: The unifier we need"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Not even regular Islam. Nation of Islam"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: https://twitter.com/RepGosar/status/1457493879003963398"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Yeah man Republicans are getting increasingly Avant garde with their shit"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Wtf"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Who was the nude blonde person he and Lauren Boebert (?) whipped (?) in the middle of that?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Oh yeah! That was a fun one. I think I backed him up by showing how great and efficient Japanese are because we destroyed those cities"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Taco Bell definitely took an early lead, but I think Activia is coming out victorious"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: She meant notion not nation"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: \"There's this notion of a God and Messiah in Islam, just like Christianity! Common ground!\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: David Montgomery back"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Bears still lose by 10+"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I like that divorced Jeff Bezos is putting extra effort into getting jacked"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Nothing like the second richest person in the world having a very normal midlife crisis"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Still nothing compared to Elon asking that guy why his pp looks like it just came"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: True. That’s an all timer"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: I'm feeling a huge game from Fields"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: If that takes place I'm feeling a huge boner"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: (relatively)"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Fuck that rapist Ben roethlisberger. GO BEARS."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Those Steelers uniforms are clean"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Peters hurt already"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Cool."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Not Peters!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: He's our best lineman"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: They look just like the ones in Dark Knight Rises, which was filmed in Pittsburgh"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Classic nagy route short of the sticks"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Why"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Why why why"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: I was reading something that our plays don't allow for YAC"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Bunch of curls, outs, and deep shots down field."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Minimal slants and screens"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Yup. Just an outdated dumb offense"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: We run more hitch routes than any other tram"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Team"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Coincidentally we also have the worst offense ever"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Also more hitch routes than trams and tramps"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: This was a Schmitty comment I had to double take to see he didn't send it"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I used to work sometimes in the building with the columns."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Wow"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: That was a catch"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: It’s the graduate chemistry and bio building for CMU"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Damn"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: That was good."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Great ball too"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Great route and throw. Pretty good coverage"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Vildor unfortunately not good"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: He's a rookie late rounder so can't blame"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Gonna go to bed early"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: No. You most stay up and suffer with me"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Defense looks about as good as it did last week"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Max you watching too"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Had a chance on that 3rd and 7"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Holy shit that graphic"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Lmaoooo"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Never said it was safe"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: You just want more business"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Stream 👏🏽 and 👏🏽 drive 👏🏽👏🏽"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Classic fucking dumb timeout getting lined up"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: This doesn't happen to other teams"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: So poorly coached"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Illegal formation out of a time out"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: So bears"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Had to poo we winning?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: The hot chicken is caught up on me"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: We are big time not"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Bulls are on NBA TV tho 👌🏿"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: But without the handoff yes"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Dumbest fucking team"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Planned sack. Nice."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Whoo TD!! Go team"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: 14 feels insurmountable"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Well when you're the worst offense it is"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: 0 points is questionable."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Fields shouldn't take that hit"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: \"Everyone thinks he's been around a long time but he's a second year player”"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: What a stupid fucking comment"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Wtf"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: He shoulda known"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Mustipher SUCKS"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Literally why did no one block watt there"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: So confusing"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Why not some shorter routes and try to get a field goal"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Leave nagy in Pittsburgh. Preferably in one of them rivers."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: And blow up all the bridges"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: I was gonna say can we fire him mid game"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: When nagy gets back to the locker room for halftime"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: If mustipher is still in the game next drive"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Idk I'm finna keep watching cause I'm a bitch but"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Where are Robinson and Mooney this game?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Weak on the interior you say? Time for some Monty ball"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Justin made em jump"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Hard count on the road"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: That would be awesome"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Nagy loves to go shotgun for 3rd and short"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Why tho"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Also shit spots but whatever"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Cole kmet came to play!"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: why do we never line up right"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: at least he's getting paid $10m for his one catch this year"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Good. Needed more room to throw"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: STOP TARGETING GRAHAM"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Literally 10 Milly per catch. Good work if you can get it"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Back to back to back back shoulder fades to graham. Even the penalty play was a fade"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Where was the penalty??"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: He just pushed him back"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: already pretty drunk"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: 3 and out, calling it"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Guess not"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Catch"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: I sure hope so"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: Like they probably would’ve called that a fumble if he dropped it in Dallas"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: In bounds"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Ayo can only do so much to keep me from taking a toaster bath. Got a lot riding on this call"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Dude some of these windows are so goddamn tight"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: And he's throwing darts"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: kmet"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: At least the announcers called it out"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Should’ve been 7"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: That was a great Fields drive though, he was 🔥"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Here's the thing man, we don't need help losing from the refs"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: they score 7 we score 3. Not gonna get it done"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Good. Another loss closer"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Less spots to trade up once we have draft picks again"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Kindle vildor is bad at football dude"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Eh. I get the optics are bad but that’s pretty standard crim law. Victim can be a very biasing term"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: “Schmitt”y? More like “Naz”-y. Him and his tradwife"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Innocent until proven guilty"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: I still don't particularly understand what a tradwife is"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: And whatnot"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: I'm glad we have a lawyer in the group to sort this out"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: it’s like a woman who’s subservient to her husband, like the good ol’ days"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Just like Jonas can answer bone related questions and I can answer real doctor questions"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: If anyone needs to blow up an Arab wedding, we got Max"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: instead of a strong, empowered, goddess like Frank"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Or Beyoncé"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Now you can still argue about the removal of the bias being biased. Is it as likely to be determined by a judge that “victim” is prejudicial when the defendant is white as when he’s black?"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I don’t know the stats but it’s worthy of consideration"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Carter is guns. You’re startups"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: It's still hilarious to me that that's how we found out he had COVID"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah. It’s definitely a prolonged issue! I’m a bit surprised. I would say it’s on surging demand and strong wage growth so it’s not the worst thing. We’ll see.

{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Definitely buy silver though. Gold never worked out but silver… that’s something special"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Also bald with a resting white supremacist face"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: That's a redundancy with Jonas tho"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah. Tradwife is just another term for very traditional gender roles"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: When you’re woke you gotta come up with new lingo constantly"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Yeah but bones are his thing"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: A guy can be two things"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Religious too"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Interesting (bad) use of felony murder"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Uhhhhhh"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: It's pretty bad, but that's where felony murder gets us"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: How does that work tho"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: The argument is that the police only fired because they were responding to the other gun fire. If the other gun fire is a felony (gang charge or reckless discharge of a firearm or whatever it may be), then many jurisdictions will tag them with the resulting death as a murder because they were committing an inherently dangerous felony"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Depends on whether the state follows the \"agency rule\" or the \"proximate cause rule\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Sorry, this was poorly worded. Tag them means tag the original people involved in the gun fire, not the police."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: So if the girls dad kills those officers, those teenagers are never getting out of prison because they'll be cop killers"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: So the cops aren't at fault for actually popping tht girl?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Well they could have chosen to charge the cops"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: But haven't"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Illinois has proximal cause"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Obviously not. She was holding a quantum physics textbook"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: https://twitter.com/nbcphiladelphia/status/1458518595613470721?s=21"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Lol. Felony murder liability usually ends when the original felon(s) get to a place of \"temporary safety\""}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Just curious, how did you know that off hand?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: I didn’t, I looked it up"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: I need to know what kind of things I can be proximally charged with"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Apparently a lot"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Well at least for felony murder you have to start by committing an inherently dangerous felony"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: So I'd start with avoiding doing that"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Then you'll avoid the resulting murder charges"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Why is discharging a firearm a felony?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I don't know that it is but there has to be a predicate felony. I was just giving examples of what it might be"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/fulltext.asp?DocName=072000050K24-1.5"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: What if Carter distracts me so I shoot Krishnan, but it was Krishnan who distracted Carter?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Reckless discharge of a firearm is a class 4 felony in IL"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Apparently"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Do we call that a draw?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: If you want to get even more fucked up, the liability extends equally to all participants"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Suppose you and your friend agree to steal a purse from someone on the street but it turns out your friend brings a gun and then a cop shoots your friend when pursuing you and your friend dies"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: You can get tagged for murder of your friend"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: In a proximal cause state"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Or suppose the cop shoots at you or your friend and kills an innocent bystander, you can get tagged for that too"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: The theme is that you get in trouble when the cops kill someone"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah. Doesn't even have to be cops"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Could be a bystander"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: The most proximal black person"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Suppose you go to rob the woman and she trips and falls and dies 10 days later. There's an argument for you to be charged with felony murder there too"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Just because your friend brought a gun"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: *dies from her injuries from tripping. You still need but for causation"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Thankfully, at least, most states follow agency rule: you're only liable for what you and your coconspirators do yourselves"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Oh actually Illinois just switched to the agency theory this year"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Good but it would be better to do away with it"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: I like this butterfly effect law stuff. We can just send bad people to jail, or kill them and keep good people like cops clean"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Did he have to change his advanced directive before he got intubated or was it just like verbal consent?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: It wasn't a real advanced directive, just a dumb piece of paper. The equivalent of those \"persuant to whatever law, I do not give Facebook permission to monitor my data\" copy paste things"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: What does this have to do with selling stock though?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Or just get founder's shares of one in your roth IRA"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Needed to cover his tax burden"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Well he has very little cash and needed cash to pay the taxes"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: On exercising the options that were set to expire"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: But he didn't need to sell those particular shares. He had the option to do lifo accounting for a higher cost basis"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: I don’t get what you mean there"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: First in First out (FIFO) would mean selling shares at a lower cost basis, resulting in higher profit and taxes owed. If he had instead sold some stock he was awarded more recently, there would have been less profit and a lower tax burden"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Sure but you said “those particular shares”"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: For me it's just checking a box for fifo or lifo. He sold fifo when he may have had the lifo option"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Also factoring in was holding time and resulting capital gains rate. Perhaps he did sell newer shares, which could have resulted in short term capital gains taxes"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: If they were part of a compensation package then it should be taxed as regular income"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Isn’t it taxed at the time it’s given though? He probably paid nothing on his founder shares"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Oh I guess it’s only if you file an 83b. Taxes are so complicated"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Wouldn't be if you were filthy rich. Then you'd know exactly what you wrote into law"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah. The taxes are also different whether it’s a grant or an option."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Options aren’t taxed when given (for now) only when exercised and taxes depend on the nature of the option and whether you exercise and hold or exercise and sell"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Stock vs option*"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: Do y'all get COVID tested every time anyone in your house has cold symptoms?"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: At some point it seems impossible to hold down a job, so then where's the money coming from?"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Matt: Yeah LMM is a playwright and hype man, not a great singer"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Exactly. It became cool to LOVE Hamilton and passé to not have seen it and I think that made people take a more extreme attitude about it than the work actually warranted."}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: It’s like Wicked also got stupid popular and it’s sort of the same thing. Just periodically a musical escapes Broadway’s orbit"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: And then it becomes must see"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Max: So you just hate things that people like"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Because tomorrow you could double your money supply and increase GDP, but you haven’t actually added any value or progress to the world? That’s how I meant it at least"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Frank: Isn’t GDP based on exchange?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Frank: I give you a dollar (doing a transaction) you give that dollar (doing another transaction) GDP is $2 even though money supply is constant"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Oh ok. Is that really a measure of progress though?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Frank: Money supply does have an impact: I needed that dollar to get the whole thing going, but it isn’t like… inherent"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: So it includes a lot of government spending but I don’t think that makes it meaningless. Yes, the government can “pump” GDP by spending more but even MMTers would agree that there are other mechanisms that constrain spending so it’s not like GDP is just an arbitrary number because the government makes it that way"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Full on communist countries would still have a GDP and measuring its change over time is still indicative of progress because it signifies that the total value created by the society (denominated in currency) is growing"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Seems legit"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Jonas: 🤔"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Lmao"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Also the shitty thing about this is everyone lost their gas fees."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: And the gas fees for the transaction back lol"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: What is a dao"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Decentralized autonomous organization"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: Fuck does that mean"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: It's like a pseudo-company that's run by a contract on the ethereum blockchain"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Roshan: Like if zuckerberg were literally an algorithm"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: People are shareholders and the contract has the rules for the company. There are no employees"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Well, I realize I shouldn't say no employees. The idea is there are no directors. That management occurs by vote of the shareholders and decisions are executed automatically by the smart contract."}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Krishnan: So these nerds got cucked basically"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Yeah. The DAO isn’t doing anything nefarious. They collected the donations and are giving them back (per the contract) but the way the tech works, there’s a transaction fee in both directions that donors are paying"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: But the fee is like $50 one way on a $200 transaction (the average donation size to the DAO)"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: That was worded slightly vaguely. The fee is basically independent of transaction size but it mostly eats up the average contribution to do it both ways"}

{"prompt":"","completion":"Schmitty: Wait, everything after \"--generate\" is the bot?"}

At her 3 month follow up she walked into clinic. She's been doing great and mom is super happy. Makes me feel warm on the inside."}
