{"prompt":"","completion":" Yeah, those aren't the same thing at all"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And there is certainly something to be said about breakthrough mutations."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You conveniently linked a 2 minute part of an hour long segment as if that's the only thing he's discussing."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Just because you disagree with his statement doesn't mean he's lying. Sorry, that's disingenuous"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Also, what makes you think you are more qualified to have opinions on the topic than him?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I would think breakthrough mutations of a virus would actually be in an evolutionary biologists purview"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Yes, I'm saying that you are being disingenuous to say he is \"lying\" rather than actually countering his claim"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Merely saying it's \"baseless\" isn't good enough"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" He's not claiming it has made the pandemic worse. He's claiming that it could make it worse due to breakthrough mutations that would effectively be a new virus requiring new vaccines and immunity."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And again, he's having a nuanced discussion about all of this over the span of dozens of hours of talking about it. Which includes analyzing every angle."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Yet you link a 2 minute long media matters clip instead of presenting his views in its entirety"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You're hilarious"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Now THAT'S disingenuous"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You can disagree with him about the risk of breakthrough mutations, but you are instead saying he is lying and misrepresenting his entire view"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" and then saying that, since he didn't make his point in a 2 minute clip that YOU chose, that he isn't communicating effectively"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You chose 2 minutes out of an hour"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" (that you'll never watch)"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And then you're misrepresenting him as saying that the vaccines HAVE made things worse rather than discussing that they have the potential to make them worse. Two totally different claims"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" This is obviously independent of the concerns of the severe adverse reactions and unknown long term affects of the vaccines, which is also something that he talks about in depth."}

{"prompt":"","completion":" ￼ Sorry it took me a while to reply to your posts from last night. I definitely appreciate you taking the time to write all of that up but I still don't agree with you assessment that he is intentionally misleading \/ lying \/ grifting \/ etc. Obviously scientists disagree routinely and that is a part of the scientific method, so it's fine if you don't agree with his hypotheses. I just don't think it's fair to say he is a grifter and\/or knowingly lying about this stuff in order to make money. From every conversation I have heard with him, while he is certainly a contrarian, he tackles the issue from the standpoint of trying to get to the truth of the matter and trying to help. If anything, speaking out on this topic has cost him a substantial amount of money. (He claims to have lost 1\/2 of his income due to YouTube completely demonetizing his channel). \n\nRegarding all of the vaccine mutation hypotheses, it wasn't something I had heard him speak about in depth so I found an interview he did with a virologist \/ vaccinologist  that goes in depth on the topic. It's actually a really interesting discussion IMO. While it certainly falls into the category of a \"hypothesis\", the argument seems logically coherent and should at least be something worthy of debate. I would try to summarize the hypothesis, but it's a bit complicated and obviously out of my domain of competence, so if you're interested in hearing the full argument give it a listen.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=BNyAovuUxro"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The point is that in order for it to be a \"grift\", he would have to be knowingly lying in order to profit from a situation. I don't think he's doing either."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In most of his podcasts he is literally thinking through the entire debate \/ argument out loud and admits that most of what he is laying out is his own personal hypotheses, and that he could ultimately be proven wrong. There's nothing wrong with that in the domain of science. We need people who are challenging the status quo in order to advance our understanding in the long run. I think it is wrong and ultimately counterproductive to censor legitimate scientific conversations no matter how provocative the topic is.\n\nAgain, you don't have to agree with him but I am personally confident that he's doing his best to think through and talk about different topics in an intellectually honest way. It sounds like you haven't listened to him in his long form podcasts and are just forming your opinion based on a made for TV interview in which he is forced to condense his views, thereby excluding nuance that is otherwise contained in the full length podcasts."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" How so? What is the difference between hypothesis and speculation then?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Yup. And they cover that in the conversation that I linked above."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" On the topic of VAERS, how is that reporting system problematic? If anything, it necessarily under represents the true number of adverse reactions due to the nature of any self reporting mechanisms. (ie, only a fraction of people will take to time to actually go through the hassle of cataloging their experience)."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" https:\/\/www.openvaers.com\/covid-data"}

{"prompt":"","completion":" It's not just 5-6k reports. It's nearly 500k reports in total"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And yes, it's clearly difficult to extrapolate the exact number of valid claims and to know causality. It's also hard to say what percentage of reactions go unreported. It could be as high as 10x by some estimates, but even the keepers of the VAERS database admit it necessarily understates any potential issue."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" So if 1\/2 of the claims are not causal, but only 10% of actual reactions get annotated, we're still talking 5x the numbers reported"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" My point was to say that there are 2 functions working in opposite directions, and it's impossible to know the proportions. What we do know is that some people have severe adverse reactions, period. And it seems to be a relatively large number. Way more than any other vaccine we have ever approved"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But this discussion apparently isn't allowed to be had in the public square. Which is the bigger issue IMO."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Big tech censorship is a real thing. You can scoff at it all you want, but it's happening more and more frequently."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I consider Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter to be the new public square since that is where the far majority of conversations are happening."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It's in the 438,000 reports to VAERS"}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Please let me know if any of you end up watching that interview I just linked. I'd be interested to hear your rebuttal if you do."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I'm happy to try to summarize, but I'm sure I was massacre it lol"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I think the reason USD pegged coins like tether are used so heavily is to avoid capital gains taxes trading in and out of other cryptos."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Yeah they are taxing the hell out of crypto and really going after people for not filing."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It's treated like any other asset though"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" So it looks like it IS a taxable event. But if someone wanted to avoid paying taxes and did it through unregulated means, it would be a lot harder to track down those records than if you traded in and out of USD going through a bank account."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I think the yield on tether is probably the bigger factor. You get 8-12% on your money."}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Yeah, you are exempt from capital gains too, assuming that you earn them while you live there"}

{"prompt":"","completion":" In order to not violate their charter 😉"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" IMO private central banks are the root cause of all of our economic ills including the record wealth inequality. Their manipulation of interest rate policy necessarily disproportionately benefits the wealthy who can tap into incredibly cheap money using leverage in order to take advantage of the resulting rise in asset prices. The inflection point is shown perfectly on this graph where the end of Bretton Woods (ie the gold standard), effectively unchains the central banks, and perfectly aligns with the decoupling of productivity and hourly compensation."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" So when the left criticizes capitalism and blames it for the wealth inequality etc, they should really be protesting the Fed & the bankers."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" That's the thing, I 100% feel for those who are disgusted with what's happening in the world. I just want to point them to the actual problem rather than blaming the greatest wealth creation tool the world has ever seen (ie free markets)."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" You should think about moving to Cuba. I heard they had great socialized medicine there!"}

{"prompt":"","completion":" But that's Krishnan's argument. That it's the US's fault."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And I say good, free the Cuban people. It's long overdue"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I'm saying that socialism and authoritarianism is evil, and when left unchecked leads to death and destruction at a level unrivaled in history. And that the ends justify the means of toppling such regimes."}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Meanwhile, Krishnan ostensibly wants to bring Cuban style socialism to the US. Which I'm maintaining is evil."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" How so? In what way could exerting economic pressure prolong the regime?"}

{"prompt":"","completion":" For the record, and a 100% advocate of people who are older and in high risk groups to get vaccinated.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Yeah but at least most of the alternative media sites are openly either conservative or liberal.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Yeah I'm honestly really surprised. It's crazy how up and down this has been and the difference a day can make."}

{"prompt":"","completion":" It's more about CNN just saying CNN things. Akin to insisting how the riots last summer were mostly peaceful. Just absolutely bullshit trash\/spin"}

{"prompt":"","completion":" I find it hard to believe that all of this was done so poorly accidentally. Like, it's just too on the nose... Surreal doesn't begin to describe it all. How in the world could we let this happen in this way? For context, I'm all for getting out of the middle east as a whole. But the way this all went down so fast and so catastrophically badly really has me at a loss for words. Are our military leaders truly that inept?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Looks about right. I also saw photos of western murals being mass painted over already. Pretty amazing"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hey. Yeah it's definitely up in the air. I actually just got home from the hospital and I'm getting set up with all the oxygen stuff. Don't count me out entirely though because it's still three plus weeks away and if I get lucky I might be totally back to normal without oxygen by then, in which case I'd love to still come!"}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Hey! Thanks so much for the message and sorry for taking a while for the reply.\n\nYeah, I'm feeling much better. In fact, I'm pretty close to 100% recovered and feeling better than ever actually. I'm just taking this time to do a total life reset and haven't been on any social media or paying attention to just about anything online (as evidenced by the fact that I haven't been involved in our Signal chat haha.)\n\nI look forward to sharing my whole story with you guys at your wedding though. It was one heck of a roller coast ride with tons of twists and turns and actually makes for a pretty crazy story.\n\nHow did everything go at your bachelor party? Did you all have a good time?"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Unfortunately I can't talk Trista into bringing Summer with\/coming, so it will just be me. \n\nI'm glad you had a great weekend out there. I've never actually been out that way but I hear it's absolutely gorgeous! I've also never been to Boston so I'm looking forward to seeing\/exploring the area. Should be a good time."}
